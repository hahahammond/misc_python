22592969,Observations during development of an internal medicine residency training program in cardiovascular limited ultrasound examination,2012,1,1,J Hosp Med,1553-5592,7,7,537-42,"Kimura, B. J. and Amundson, S. A. and Phan, J. N. and Agan, D. L. and Shaw, D. J.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Despite the future potential of using ultrasound stethoscopes to augment the bedside cardiac physical, few data exist on a general cardiovascular imaging protocol that can be taught to physicians on a perpetual basis as a curriculum in graduate medical education. METHODS: During the past decade, we developed and integrated a cardiovascular limited ultrasound training program within the confines of an internal medicine residency. The evidence-based rationale for the exam, the teaching methods, and curriculum are delineated, and subsequent observations regarding program requirements, proficiency, and academic outcomes are explored. Analysis of variance and linear regression assessed for relationships between academic scores, chief resident selection, and gender to proficiency in ultrasound. RESULTS: A brief, 5-minute cardiovascular limited ultrasound exam (CLUE) was taught using both didactic and bedside methods, and practiced primarily within the cardiology consult, outpatient clinic, and intensive care rotations. Program costs were minimized by employing readily available institutional resources. After a 2-year lead-in training phase, the subsequent 4 years of senior resident performance (n = 41 residents) showed an 81% pass rate in CLUE competency. Resident ultrasound performance did not relate to academic scores (r = 0.05, P = 0.75), chief resident selection, nor gender. Observations regarding resident pitfalls in CLUE practice and increased participation in extracurricular research are described. CONCLUSIONS: We report our initial experience in developing and implementing a training program for bedside cardiovascular ultrasound examination that employed evidence-based techniques, set proficiency goals, and assessed resident performance. It may be feasible to teach future internist-hospitalists the technique of bedside ultrasound during residency.","

Y. and Chan, T. and Chang, C. S. and Lan, J. L.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) is expensive and there is little evidence to prove the cost-effectiveness of a clinical pathway. The purpose of this study was to introduce a clinical pathway in hospitalized patients with acute PUB to evaluate its impact on costs and other outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical pathway was designed for and implemented in hospitalized patients, and a physicians reminder system that included chief residents, checklists, and case review meetings was also utilized. Use of medicine for acid suppression, length of hospital stay (LOS), and treatment costs were compared between patients before and after implementation of the clinical pathway. Outcome measures included the rate of recurrent bleeding, rate of repeat upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy, and rate of readmission within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS: This clinical pathway significantly reduced the use of intravenous medicine for acid suppression from 88% to 34%, with mean LOS down from 6.7 to 3.6 days, mean cost of medications decreased from New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) 8768 to NTD 3940 (cost down 55.1%), mean cost of diagnostic tests lowered from NTD 12,560 to NTD 9493 (cost down 24.4%), and mean total hospital cost down from NTD 33,142 to NTD 19,519 (cost down 41.1%). Outcome measures were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of a clinical pathway is an effective method for reducing costs while maintaining quality of care in the management of PUB.","

M.",,Eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate current patterns of training in neonatal resuscitation in US residency programs in general pediatrics. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to the chief residents and directors of all US residency programs in general pediatrics to determine who provides supervision and teaching of neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit. This questionnaire also inquired as to the use within these residency programs of standardized resuscitation training courses such as Pediatric Advanced Life Support and Neonatal Resuscitation Program. RESULTS: Residents in their third and second years of training are most often cited as responsible for supervision and teaching of neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room, whereas attending neonatologists are cited most frequently as being responsible for these tasks in the neonatal intensive care unit. Pediatric Advanced Life Support is required by virtually all US residency programs, followed in frequency by Neonatal Resuscitation Program and Advanced Cardiac Life Support. CONCLUSIONS: Because those in training collectively provide much of the supervision and teaching of neonatal resuscitation, vigilance is required so that appropriate resuscitation skills are developed and maintained. Objective performance markers may be useful in assessing competency in caring for sick newborns.neonatal resuscitation, delivery room, Neonatal Resuscitation Program, Pediatric Advanced Life Support, Advanced Cardiac Life Support.","

The majority of the world's children live in developing countries, and education related to global child health is important for paediatric residents. METHODS: Chief residents and program directors from the 16 Canadian paediatric training programs were surveyed using a questionnaire regarding global child health training program content, electives, attitudes and perceptions towards global child health. RESULTS: No programs had a formalised global health curriculum. All program directors and chief residents reported that programs offer global child health sessions, but 50% of the programs did not address six out of twelve of the content areas including topics such as refugee health and international adoption. All program directors agreed global child health understanding is important for paediatric trainees; 83% agreed more emphasis should be placed on this during post-graduate training. DISCUSSION: A formalised global child health curriculum is lacking for Canadian paediatric residents: Program directors are willing to integrate global child health training modules into their post-graduate training programs.","1469-5804     Audcent, Tobey Ann     MacDonnell, Heather     Samson, Lindy     Brenner, Jennifer L     Journal Article     India     Educ Health (Abingdon). 2013 May-Aug;26(2):73-7. doi: 10.4103/1357-6283.120693.

When last surveyed in 2003, Canadian RO residents identified job availability as their main concern. Our objective was to survey current Canadian RO residents on their training and career plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Trainees from the 13 Canadian residency programs using the national matching service were sought. Potential respondents were identified through individual program directors or chief resident and were e-mailed a secure link to an online survey. Descriptive statistics were used to report responses. RESULTS: The eligible response rate was 53% (83/156). Similar to the 2003 survey, respondents generally expressed high satisfaction with their programs and specialty. The most frequently expressed perceived weakness in their training differed from 2003, with 46.5% of current respondents feeling unprepared to enter the job market. 72% plan on pursuing a postresidency fellowship. Most respondents intend to practice in Canada. Fewer than 20% of respondents believe that there is a strong demand for radiation oncologists in Canada. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents to the current survey expressed significant satisfaction with their career choice and training program. However, differences exist compared with the 2003 survey, including the current perceived lack of demand for radiation oncologists in Canada.","1879-355x     Debenham, Brock     Banerjee, Robyn     Fairchild, Alysa     Dundas, George     Trotter, Theresa     Yee, Don     Journal Article     United States     Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Mar 15;82(4):1326-31. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.04.030.

Recent studies demonstrate that most family doctors are not providing the full range of contraception options or early abortions. This new study was designed to describe the current training in family medicine, and whether new contraceptive methods and medication abortion are included. Method: Program directors (PD) and chief residents (CR) at 454 US family medicine residency programs were emailed a link to an online quantitative survey adapted from the original Steinauer study. Nonresponders were mailed paper surveys and telephone reminders were made. 220 PDs and 98 CRs responded, representing 54% of all surveyed programs. Data were analyzed using SPSS and Excel. Results: Family planning: CRs reported receiving clinical training as follows: OCPs 100%; DMPA 92%; hormonal IUD 78%; emergency contraception 75%; copper IUD 71%; tubal ligation 60%; hormonal implant 20%. Abortion: PDs indicated abortion training is routine at 7% of family residency programs and optional at 42%. 32% of PDs reported that residents receive clinical training in medication abortion; 23% report that residents receive some aspiration abortion training. CRs' clinical experience with at least one abortion method more than doubled since the 1997 study. Conclusions: Abortion training in family medicine residencies has increased since 1997, and all residents receive some training in contraception. Nonetheless, training in abortion and the complete range of contraception options must be increased to prepare family physicians to provide full-spectrum reproductive health care.","

T. and Nikolaidis, P.",,eng,,,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive training in cardiac imaging during radiology residency is imperative if radiologists are to maintain a significant role in this rapidly growing field. In this study, radiology chief residents were surveyed to assess the current status of cardiac imaging training in radiology residency programs. The responses to this survey may be helpful in understanding current trends in cardiac imaging training and how such training can be improved in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chief residents at accredited radiology residency programs were sent an e-mail with a link to a 17-question Web-based survey. The survey assessed the organization of cardiac imaging training in each residency program, imaging modalities incorporated into cardiac imaging training, the role of residents on cardiac imaging rotations, and attitudes of residents about their cardiac imaging training and the future of cardiac imaging. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 52 of 112 (46%) programs. Seventy-one percent had at least one dedicated cardiac imaging rotation during their residencies. Fifty-two percent and 62% of respondents reported <5 hours of cardiac imaging-related case conferences and didactic lectures per year, respectively. Most had cardiac computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging incorporated into their cardiac imaging training. Although 92% felt that cardiac imaging training is important, only 17% felt that they currently received adequate training in cardiac imaging. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of residency programs represented in this survey had at least one dedicated cardiac imaging rotation for their residents. Most of these programs had few cardiac imaging-related conferences and lectures per year. Although most chief residents believed that cardiac imaging training is important, only a minority felt that they currently received adequate training in cardiac imaging.","1878-4046     Minocha, Jeet     Yaghmai, Vahid     Hammond, Nancy     Pyrros, Ayis T     Nikolaidis, Paul     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 2010 Jun;17(6):795-8. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2010.02.002.

L. and Giardino, A. P. and Harris, T. and Tran, X. G. and Yoon, J. and Phillips, J. L.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: This study examined institutional strategies among pediatric residency programs for recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (URM) housestaff. PROCEDURES: A questionnaire developed by the authors in a 1992 study was modified and then mailed to 185 pediatric chief residents at non-military pediatric training programs in the United States. Descriptive statistics (means and frequency) were calculated for each question. There were three rounds of mailings and a telephone follow-up. MAIN FINDING: The response rate was 39% (n=73). Thirty-eight percent reported that URM housestaff recruitment and retention was a priority for their program directors, 37% reported that it was a priority for themselves, 25% reported it was a priority for the hospital administration, and 36% reported that they were not sure about the priority of URM housestaff recruitment and retention within their organization. Sixty-seven percent stated that their housestaff selection committees do not have defined recruitment goals, 6% indicated that their committees have specifically defined recruitment goals, and 27% were not sure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite numerous initiatives from government agencies, medical institutions, and institutions of higher education, a critical gap remains among institutions in their recruitment efforts for URM at the level of residency training. Our study suggests that pediatric chief residents may not be adequately educated or primed regarding the importance of recruitment and retention of URM.

S. and Beasley, B. W.",,eng,,,"CONTEXT: Chief residents play a crucial role in internal medicine residency programs in administration, academics, team building, and coordination between residents and faculty. The work-life and demographic characteristics of chief residents has not been documented. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the demographics and day-to-day activities of chief residents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Survey Committee of the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) developed a Web-based questionnaire. A link was sent in November 2006 by e-mail to 381 member programs (98%). Data collection ended in April 2007. MEASUREMENTS: Data collected include the number of chief residents per residency, the ratio of chief residents per resident, demographics, and information on salary/benefits, training and mentoring, and work life. RESULTS: The response rate was 62% (N = 236). There was a mean of 2.5 chief residents per program, and on average there was 1 chief resident for 17.3 residents. Of the chief residents, 40% were women, 38% international medical graduates, and 11% minorities. Community-based programs had a higher percentage of postgraduate year 3 (PGY-3)-level chief residents compared to university-based programs (22% versus 8%; P = .02). Mean annual salary was $60 000, and the added value of benefits was $21 000. Chief residents frequently supplement their salaries through moonlighting. The majority of formal training occurs by attending APDIM meetings. Forty-one percent of programs assign academic rank to chief residents. CONCLUSION: Most programs have at least 2 chief residents and expect them to perform administrative functions, such as organizing conferences. Most programs evaluate chief residents regularly in administration, teaching, and clinical skills.","Singh, Dushyant     McDonald, Furman S     Beasley, Brent W     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2009 Sep;1(1):150-4. doi: 10.4300/01.01.0025.

P., Jr. and Eaton, J. and Hopkins, M.",,,,,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain current faculty attitudes regarding teaching of vaginal breech delivery (VBD) and external cephalic version (ECV). STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire was sent to obstetrics and gynecology residency programs. Respondents were queried regarding demographic parameters, resident and practice experience, and attitudes toward teaching these procedures. RESULTS: Fifty-four (96%) surveys were returned. Sixteen (30%) respondents were female and 38 (70%) male. Sixteen (30%) completed residency prior to 1980, 17 (32%) during the 1980s and 21 (48%) during the 1990s. Nineteen (35%) trained locally. Forty-seven (87%) received training in VBD during residency. Thirty-five (65%) received training in ECV. Thirty-two (60%) had performed VBDs in practice. However, only 18 (33%) continued to perform this procedure. During the proceeding three years, they reported performing an average of five VBDs per chief resident per year. Thirty-seven (69%) performed ECV in clinical practice. The 17 who did not indicated that they referred to others. They reported performing an average of 15 ECVs per chief resident per year. Fifty-two (96%) thought residents should still be taught VBD. All faculty thought that residents should be taught ECV. None of the above parameters exerted a statistically significant effect on these opinions. CONCLUSION: There was nearly universal faculty support for continuing to teach VBD to residents. However, only one-third of faculty members currently perform this procedure. There do not appear to be sufficient numbers of VBDs to teach this procedure utilizing a ""hands on"" approach. There is universal support for teaching ECV. There appear to be both enough individuals with experience and enough procedures to accomplish this education.","

B. and Bernstein, J.",,eng,,,"A basic familiarity with musculoskeletal disorders is essential for all medical school graduates. The purpose of the current study was to test a group of recent medical school graduates on basic topics in musculoskeletal medicine in order to assess the adequacy of their preparation in this area. A basic-competency examination in musculoskeletal medicine was developed and validated. The examination was sent to all 157 chairpersons of orthopaedic residency programs in the United States, who were asked to rate each question for importance and to suggest a passing score. To assess the criterion validity, the examination was administered to eight chief residents in orthopaedic surgery. The study population comprised all eighty-five residents who were in their first postgraduate year at our institution; the examination was administered on their first day of residency. One hundred and twenty-four (81 per cent) of the 154 orthopaedic residency-program chairpersons who received the survey responded to it. The chairpersons rated twenty-four of the twenty-five questions as at least important. The mean passing score (and standard deviation) that they recommended for the assessment of basic competency was 73.1 +/- 6.8 per cent. The mean score for the eight orthopaedic chief residents was 98.5 +/- 1.07 per cent, and that for the eighty-five residents in their first postgraduate year was 59.6 +/- 12 per cent. Seventy (82 per cent) of the eighty-five residents failed to demonstrate basic competency on the examination according to the chairpersons' criterion. The residents who had taken an elective course in orthopaedic surgery in medical school scored higher on the examination (mean score, 68.4 per cent) than did those who had taken only a required course in orthopaedic surgery (mean score, 57.9 per cent) and those who had taken no rotation in orthopaedic surgery (mean score, 55.9 per cent) (p = 0.005 and p = 0.001, respectively). In summary, seventy (82 per cent) of eighty-five medical school graduates failed a valid musculoskeletal competency examination. We therefore believe that medical school preparation in musculoskeletal medicine is inadequate.","

Global markets, international travel and migration are resulting in changes to our domestic landscapes. Since the majority of the world's children live in developing countries, education related to global child health (GCH) issues is particularly important for paediatric residents. The objective of this study was to assess formal exposure to GCH by Canadian Paediatric residents. Methods: A 22 question, self-administered, online survey was developed and validated de novo using content experts and the CanMEDS framework of physician competencies to define survey items. The survey domains included knowledge/content, attitudes and behaviours regarding ICH education in residency training. Chief residents (CR) and program directors (PD) from all Canadian paediatric residency training programs were invited to respond. Quantitative questions used a 4-point Likert scale and were analysed using descriptive statistics with common themes extracted from responses to qualitative questions. CHEO's Research Ethics Board approved the study. Results: The overall response rate was 52% (24/46 surveys completed). Twelve of sixteen PD (75%) and twelve of thirty CR (40%) completed the survey representing 81% of training programs. All PD and CR reported that their respective paediatric training programs offered some GCH sessions but no program had a formalized GCH curriculum. Of the twelve GCH content areas surveyed (including topics such as TB and refugee and immigrant health), only one (cultural sensitivity) was universally included. Despite gaps in GCH topics covered in their curriculum, 100% of respondents agreed GCH knowledge directly contributes to the attainment of CanMeds roles competency, specifically those of medical expert, communicator and health advocate. All PD agreed that GCH is important for paediatric trainees; 83% agreed more emphasis should be placed on GCH during postgraduate training. Most CR and PD (81% and 100% respectively) agreed that residents from their programs had benefited from GCH electives. 91% of PD indicated their program would be interested in new initiatives regarding GCH and that GCH educational modules (approx. 6 hrs) could be incorporated into their formal resident curriculum. Conclusions: Although reported interest in GCH by residents is high, minimal formal training in GCH is offered through Canadian paediatric training programs. GCH modules designed to be integrated into core postgraduate programs would offer a potential opportunity to close this gap.","88th Annual Conference Abstracts of the Canadian Paediatric Society.

F., Jr. and Galgano, M. T.",,eng,,,"Residents in anatomic pathology are allowed increased diagnostic responsibility including the initial interpretation of intraoperative frozen-section consultations during their years of training. This frozen-section responsibility requires staff faculty backup for diagnostic confirmation and consultation. In this study, we tested a telepathology system using an ultra portable computer with a 4.5-in diagonal screen (scrolled image size of 2.5 x 1.75 in, width x height) and both wireless Local Area Network (LAN) final connection from a DSL and wireless Wide Area Network (WAN) telecommunications. The diagnostic agreement for a chief resident/faculty staff duo using telepathology for 100 consecutive frozen-section cases (50 with wireless LAN final connection and 50 with wireless WAN) with limited clinical information was compared with the original frozen-section diagnosis rendered by other staff pathologists. There was diagnostic agreement for 95 of the 100 cases. For the 5 that were discordant, 2 were deemed to be errors in the original frozen-section diagnosis; 1 was not clinically important; and 2 were believed to have potential clinical implications. For the 2 having potential clinical importance, the absence of knowledge of the gross findings in each case and the preoperative biopsy results for one specimen contributed to the misinterpretation of the frozen sections. The median time between transmission of image(s) from the chief resident to the faculty consultant until diagnosis by the latter was 1 minute 42 seconds for wireless WAN and 51 seconds for the wireless LAN final connection to the display device. We conclude that a telepathology system using an ultra portable computer and wireless telecommunications is useful for frozen-section consultation between an experienced resident and a faculty member in pathology.","

rayyan-4876524,Impact of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education work-hour regulations on neurosurgical resident education and productivity,2009,1,1,J Neurosurg,0022-3085,110,5,820-7,"Jagannathan, J. and Vates, G. E. and Pouratian, N. and Sheehan, J. P. and Patrie, J. and Grady, M. S. and Jane, J. A.",,eng,,,"OBJECT: Recently, the Institute of Medicine examined resident duty hours and their impact on patient safety. Experts have suggested that reducing resident work hours to 56 hours per week would further decrease medical errors. Although some reports have indicated that cutbacks in resident duty hours reduce errors and make resident life safer, few authors have specifically analyzed the effect of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) duty-hour limits on neurosurgical resident education and the perceived quality of training. The authors have evaluated multiple objective surrogate markers of resident performance and quality of training to determine the impact of the 80-hour workweek. METHODS: The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 data on neurosurgical applicants entering ACGME-accredited programs between 1998 and 2007 (before and after the implementation of the work-hour rules) were obtained from the Society of Neurological Surgeons. The American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS) written examination scores for this group of residents were also acquired. Resident registration for and presentations at the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) annual meetings between 2002 and 2007 were examined as a measure of resident academic productivity. As a case example, the authors analyzed the distribution of resident training hours in the University of Virginia (UVA) neurosurgical training program before and after the institution of the 80-hour workweek. Finally, program directors and chief residents in ACGME-accredited programs were surveyed regarding the effects of the 80-hour workweek on patient care, resident training, surgical experience, patient safety, and patient access to quality care. Respondents were also queried about their perceptions of a 56-hour workweek. RESULTS: Despite stable mean USMLE Step 1 scores for matched applicants to neurosurgery programs between 2000 and 2008, ABNS written examination scores for residents taking the exam for self-assessment decreased from 310 in 2002 to 259 in 2006 (16% decrease, p < 0.05). The mean scores for applicants completing the written examination for credit also did not change significantly during this period. Although there was an increase in the number of resident registrations to the AANS meetings, the number of abstracts presented by residents decreased from 345 in 2002 to 318 in 2007 (7% decrease, p < 0.05). An analysis of the UVA experience suggested that the 80-hour workweek leads to a notable increase in on-call duty hours with a profound decrease in the number of hours spent in conference and the operating room. Survey responses were obtained from 110 program directors (78% response rate) and 122 chief residents (76% response rate). Most chief residents and program directors believed the 80-hour workweek compromised resident training (96%) and decreased resident surgical experience (98%). Respondents also believed that the 80-hour workweek threatened patient safety (96% of program directors and 78% of chief residents) and access to quality care (82% of program directors and 87% of chief residents). When asked about the effects of a 56-hour workweek, all program directors and 98% of the chief residents indicated that resident training and surgical education would be further compromised. Most respondents (95% of program directors and 84% of chief residents) also believed that additional work-hour restrictions would jeopardize patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological surgery continues to attract top-quality resident applicants. Test scores and levels of participation in national conferences, however, indicate that the 80-hour workweek may adversely affect resident training. Subjectively, neurosurgical program directors and chief residents believe that the 80-hour workweek makes neurosurgical training and the care of patients more difficult. Based on experience with the 80-hour workweek, educators think that a 56-hour workweek would further compromise neurosurgical training and patient care in the US.","

METHODS: (1) Organizational Change-The Department of Medicine established a patient safety committee (PSC) and charged it with reviewing adverse events. (2) Cultural Change-PSC sponsors and participants work to promote a culture of collaboration, study, learning, and prevention versus a culture of blame. (3) Collaboration-The PSC includes chief residents and members from medical informatics, nursing, pharmacy, quality assurance, risk management, and utilization management. (4) Evolution-The duties of the PSC progressed from merely learning from adverse event reports to implementing patient safety and quality improvement projects. (5) Standardization-The PSC uses standard definitions and procedures when reviewing cases of adverse events, and when conducting patient safety and quality improvement projects. RESULTS: (1) Developed an online adverse event reporting system, shortening the average report collection time by 2 days and increasing the number of adverse events reported. (2) Established a model for change using (a) safety rounds with residents, (b) e-mail safety alerts, and, in some cases, (c) decision alerts using electronic order entry. These changes in culture and capability led to improvements in care and improved financial results. CONCLUSIONS: Senior management support of a culture of learning and prevention and an organizational structure that promotes collaboration has provided an environment in which patient safety initiatives can flourish by providing not only safer and higher quality patient care but also a positive financial return on investment.","

J. and Tortolani, A. J.",,eng,,,"This study examines the reliability and accuracy of ratings by general surgery residents of surgical faculty. Twenty-three of 33 residents anonymously and voluntarily evaluated 62 surgeons in June, 1988; 24 of 28 residents evaluated 64 surgeons in June, 1989. Each resident rated each surgeon on a 5-point scale for each of 10 areas of performance: technical ability, basic science knowledge, clinical knowledge, judgment, peer relations, patient relations, reliability, industry, personal appearance, and reaction to pressure. Reliability analyses evaluated internal consistency and interrater correlation. Accuracy analyses evaluated halo error, leniency/severity, central tendency, and range restriction. Ratings had high internal consistency (coefficient alpha = 0.97). Interrater correlations were moderately high (average Pearson correlation = 0.63 among raters). Ratings were generally accurate, with halo error most prevalent and some evidence of leniency. Ratings by chief residents had the least halo. Results were generally replicable across the two academic years. We conclude that anonymous ratings of surgical faculty by groups of residents can provide a reliable and accurate evaluation method, ratings by chief residents are most accurate, and halo error may pose the greatest threat to accuracy, pointing to the need for greater definition of evaluation items and scale points.","

C. and Spiess, P. E. and Ross, P. L. and Taguchi, Y. and Aprikian, A. G.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) and The American Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) general objectives mandate that all residents be competent to independently perform select surgical procedures. Unfortunately, no objective standardized measures presently exist for surgical training assessment. Operative logs have been implemented to quantify the number of cases the resident has been exposed to, however, these do not assess their degree of involvement or aptitude. An analysis of what exactly a resident performs, and how well, per case may assist in measuring their training progress. Herein, we evaluate a questionnaire to quantify the level of resident participation in radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) and assess whether resident perception of how much involvement in a case correlates with staff surgeons. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Identical, self-administered questionnaires were distributed simultaneously to the resident and staff urologist upon completion of radical prostatectomy. The questionnaire comprised of 14 items, which were completed independently by the resident and the staff urologist. The items assessed which of the 14 specific surgical steps were actually performed by the resident. An analysis was performed to assess the level of agreement. RESULTS: Among all cases performed between June 2002 and July 2003, 64 RRPs performed by two surgeons had completed questionnaires by both resident and staff. Twenty-one (32.8%) cases were performed with a senior resident (R4) and 43 (67.2%) cases were performed with a chief resident (R5). Twenty (31.3%) cases involved pelvic lymph node dissection. Resident performance of key surgical steps, namely dorsal venous ligation, urethral division, lateral pedicle dissection and urethrovesical anastamosis was 59.4%, 62.5%, 84% and 59.4% respectively. Global level of agreement between staff and resident responses was 94.9% (71.4%-100%). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there exists good agreement between resident perception of their level of involvement in RRP and staff validation. As such, a residents' assessment of their participation is likely to be accurate. Designation of performance of key operative steps into logs may be more relevant than recording simple exposure to index cases. Attempts at measuring quality of key operative steps in the future may be beneficial.","

rayyan-5223841,The in-house education of clinical clerks in surgery and the role of housestaff,2002,1,1,Am J Surg,0002-9610 (Print) 0002-9610,184,5,471-5,"Minor, S. and Poenaru, D.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: While on surgical rotations, clinical clerks spend more time on the ward and in the emergency department than in any other location. Consequently, their in-house experience is of great importance to their education-yet the teaching processes in these settings have never been fully explored. Unlike the structured pre-clerkship years, the exact breakdown of a clerk's hospital-based education is difficult to elucidate. To effectively evaluate a clerkship curriculum, it is essential to know what clerks are being taught outside of seminars, how that teaching occurs, and by whom. This study proposes a methodology by which a surgical clerkship curriculum can be evaluated. METHODS: For the purpose of the study, surgery clerks carried written and audio logs of their informal teaching encounters during one on-call period (30 hours). These included who taught them, where, by what methods, for how long, and what prompted the teaching. A survey of similar variables was administered to all clerks who rotated through general surgery over 4 months and to all general surgery residents. RESULTS: Four clerks returned completed logs (100% response rate), and 17 clerks (85% response) and 15 residents (100% response) were surveyed. Audiotaped and written logs were similar, demonstrating good recall. Students recorded an average of 11 teaching encounters (range 3 to 20) per 30 hour period, lasting a total of 73 minutes (range 17 to 178) and each 6.7 +/- 14 minutes long. Both logs and surveys identified most teaching as unsolicited, done mostly by junior and chief residents, focused chiefly on diagnosis and using a Socratic style. Most teaching occurred in the operating room, yet its occurrence was unpredictable; in surveys the emergency room and clinic settings were perceived as more important. Staff surgeons contributed 27% of the logged encounters yet were perceived in surveys as the least contributors. Residents' and clerks' perceptions of teaching were similar except for residents overvaluing the amount of senior teaching (P = 0.04). The resident level correlated significantly with the comfort of teaching (r = 0.618, P = 0.04). Senior residents encouraged more problem-solving, whereas juniors favored minilectures. Only one resident had received formal teaching instruction. CONCLUSIONS: Informal teaching of surgery clerks is variable and occurs through multiple short encounters in many settings and by various trainees. Efforts to improve the teaching process should focus on providing formal teaching instruction early in residency, specifically geared toward short encounters in flexible settings. Both the operating room as a learning environment and staff surgeons as informal teachers must be intentionally integrated into the teaching process.","

We instituted morning report (MR) at the University of Virginia primarily as a means to accomplish these objectives. Serendipitously MR has become an integral educational tool for the surgical residents. The rationale for the format and instructional design are discussed in the context of learning theory. METHODS: The chief residents as primary stakeholders were strongly encouraged to play a leadership role in designing MR. A faculty- led didactic format was rejected because of the importance of focusing on resident team building, and leadership, but poor faculty participation was also an issue. RESULTS: The initial obstacles included timing, and designing the format. CONCLUSIONS: MR is an opportunity for residents to exercise and improve their knowledge, leadership, presentation and problem-solving skills. We would hypothesise that the advantages for teaching are many and include that residents are prepared for actual clinical problems in a supportive environment with opportunities for immediate feedback and assessment. Reports of educational effectiveness of MR are mostly anecdotal and further studies are needed to characterise the types of learning and teaching that occur during MR and to document educational effectiveness.","

METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 7 categories and 36 question items was distributed to 16 senior chief residents of orthodontic department at 11 dental university hospitals and 5 medical university hospitals in Korea. All respondents completed the questionnaires and returned them. RESULTS: All of the respondents reported that they belonged to an interdisciplinary team. Nineteen percent indicated that they use presurgical infant orthopedic (PSIO) appliances. The percentage of respondents who reported they were 'unsure' about the methods about for cleft repair operation method was relatively high. Eighty-six percent reported that the orthodontic treatment was started at the deciduous or mixed dentition. Various answers were given regarding the amount of maxillary expansion for alveolar bone graft and the estimates of spontaneous or forced eruption of the upper canine. Sixty-seven percent reported use of a rapid maxillary expansion appliance as an anchorage device for maxillary protraction with a facemask. There was consensus among respondents regarding daily wearing time, duration of treatment, and amount of orthopedic force. Various estimates were given for the relapse percentage after maxillary advancement distraction osteogenesis (MADO). Most respondents did not have sufficient experience with MADO. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that education about the concepts and methods of PSIO and surgical repair, consensus regarding orthodontic management protocols, and additional MADO experience are needed in order to improve the quality of CLP management in Korean orthodontic residents.","2005-372x     Cho, Il-Sik     Shin, Hyo-Keun     Baek, Seung-Hak     Journal Article     Korea (South)     Korean J Orthod. 2012 Jun;42(3):100-9. doi: 10.4041/kjod.2012.42.3.100.

M.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALN) has become widely used for the management of localized renal masses and for simple nephrectomy [corrected] Centers of excellence have slowly disseminated this surgical approach throughout academic institutions and private practices. The transfer of this technique to inexperienced surgeons and centers has not been well studied. We examined our outcomes for HALN with an experienced surgeon (DMA) [corrected] at a new academic center. We also examined the effectiveness of the transfer of these techniques as trainees go out into practice [corrected] PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 85 hand-assisted laparoscopy procedures were performed between September 2001 and August 2003 of which 61 were HALN. Four fellows and eight chief residents, under the guidance of one attending surgeon (DMA), performed all HALN procedures. Parameters measured included patient age, ASA score, body mass index, operative time, estimated blood loss, number of trocars used, time to oral intake, analgesics required, length of stay, complications, and tumor size. The average patient age was 57.4 years (range 26-87 years) and the mean ASA score 2.5 (1-4). The mean BMI was 28.3 (range 20-46) [corrected] There was a slight predominance of right-sided lesions. In addition to evaluating our early results with HALN, a questionnaire was sent to all graduates of our program starting 2 years prior to the arrival of DMA to assess the application of laparoscopy to their practices [corrected] RESULTS: All cases were completed without open conversion. The total operative time averaged 184 [corrected] minutes (range 67-257 [corrected] minutes), with 80% of patients requiring two trocars. The average blood loss was 136 [corrected] ml (range 25-700 mL), but only one patient required transfusion postoperatively [corrected] The mean time to oral intake was 17.1 hours (range 1.5-240 hours), the average length of stay was 4.3 days (range 1-28 days), and total narcotic requirements averaged 111 mg of morphine sulfate equivalents (range 6.7-519 mg). Sixty-six percent of the procedures were performed for malignancy. The average tumor size in these cases was 3.9 cm (range 1-12 cm). There was one death, in an 80-year-old patient who had a bowel injury necessitating re-exploration and bowel resection. This patient had a postoperative myocardial infarction and died. Two patients developed postoperative hernias at their hand-port site. Other significant [corrected] complications included diaphragmatic [corrected] injury (repaired laparoscopically), one [corrected] pulmonary embolus, two cases of pancreatitis, and one case of pneumonia. Three patients experienced postoperative ileus. Of the 20 graduates of this program since 2000, 4 were laparoscopic/endourology fellows, and 2 of the residents pursued fellowship training after graduating. Graduates of the year 2000 and 2001 represent surgeons who graduated prior to the arrival of DMA. Of those resident graduates who did not pursue fellowship, two of the seven surgeons who graduated prior to the arrival of DMA are performing laparoscopy. Both of these surgeons pursued formal postgraduate laparoscopic training. Six of the seven non-fellowship-trained residents who graduated since DMA's arrival are performing laparoscopy; the other is early in practice and intends to do so. None of these surgeons has pursued postgraduate training prior to performing laparoscopy in their practices [corrected] CONCLUSIONS: The HALN techniques can be transferred quickly and efficiently between [corrected]one center and [corrected] another under the guidance of an experienced surgeon. Operative times are acceptable, with complication rates comparable to [corrected] previously reported series.

M.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Training of surgical residents depends on graduated autonomy in and out of the operating room. We sought to define trends in operative volume and number of teaching cases in graduating surgical residents over time. METHODS: We queried the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education general surgery case log (1999-2012) for all case categories in which graduating chief residents performed a median of 20 or more cases during their training. Median (10th and 90th percentiles) number of cases performed as surgeon chief, surgeon junior and teaching assistant (TA) were analyzed using R(2) for all trends. RESULTS: The median number of cases performed by graduating chief residents remained stable over time (965-971; R(2) = 0.01). Surgeon junior cases increased slightly (718-725; R(2) = 0.07), whereas surgeon chief cases decreased slightly (246-235; R(2) = 0.08). The most frequently performed cases were in the categories of the large intestine (125 [85,167], biliary (109 [74,167]), and abdominal hernia (99 [67.5,139]). The median number of TA cases decreased by 79% (126-27; R(2) = 0.34), with the most significant decrease occurring early in the study period (median: 126-22; R(2) = 0.91). The number of median teaching cases decreased in every category analyzed, with the most pronounced occurring in the categories of thoracic (9-0 [100%]; R(2) = 0.37) and breast (6-0 [100%]; R(2) = 0.55). The only categories with a median number of teaching cases >1 in 2012 were the large intestine (5), biliary (4), and abdominal hernia repairs (3). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relative stability of case volume over time, GSRs are graduating with relatively few cases recorded as TA. Improved opportunities for trainees to take on the role of TA while in residency may lead to improved confidence as surgeons on graduation.","

The goal of this study was to perform a needs assessment focused on surgical training to guide the creation of a curriculum by SAGES intended to improve the care of hernia patients. METHODS: Using mixed methods (interviews and online survey), the SAGES hernia task force (HTF) conducted a study asking subjects about their perceived deficits in resident training to care for hernia patients, preferred training topics about hernias, ideal learning modalities, and education development. RESULTS: Participants included 18 of 24 HTF members, 27 chief residents and fellows, and 31 surgical residents. HTF members agreed that residency exposes trainees to a wide spectrum of hernia repairs by a variety of surgeons. They cited outdated materials, techniques, and paucity of feedback. Additionally, they identified the ""see one, do one, teach one"" method of training as prevalent and clearly inadequate. The topics least addressed were system-based approach to hernia care (46 %) and patient outcomes (62 %). Training topics residents considered well covered during residency were: preoperative and intraoperative decision-making (90 %), complications (94 %), and technical approach for repairs (98 %). Instructional methods used in residency include assisted/supervised surgery (96 %), Web-based learning (24 %), and simulation (30 %). Residents' preferred learning methods included simulation (82 %), Web-based training (61 %), hands-on laboratory (54 %), and videos (47 %), in addition to supervised surgery. Trainees reported their most desired training topics as basic techniques for inguinal and ventral hernia repairs (41 %) versus advanced technical training (68 %), which mirrored those reported by attending surgeons, 36 % and 71 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was a consensus among HTF members and surgical trainees that a comprehensive, dynamic, and flexible educational program employing various media to address contemporary key deficits in the care of hernia patients would be welcomed by surgeons.","

METHODS: We used a simulation-based exit examination to assess resident readiness. Six chief residents performed 3 simulated procedures: bowel anastomosis, laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) repair, and pancreaticojejunostomy. Faculty assessed resident performance using task-specific checklists, Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), and final product analysis. RESULTS: Residents' individual task-specific checklist scores ranged from 25% to 100% across all 3 procedures. Mean OSATS scores ranged from 4.06 to 4.23/5.0. Residents scored significantly higher on ""instrument knowledge"" (mean = 4.78, standard deviation [SD] = 23) than ""time and motion"" (mean = 3.94, SD = .48, P = .025) and ""ability to adapt to individual pathologic circumstances"" (mean = 4.06, SD =.12, P = .002). Final product analysis revealed a range of errors, including incorrect technique and poor intraoperative planning. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively high OSATS ratings, residents had a wide range of errors and procedure outcomes. Exit assessments using multiple evaluation metrics may improve awareness of residents' learning needs.","

Methods: The house staff and faculty of HIRUDAG and the Arnhold Global Health Institute of Mount Sinai collaborated to assess clinical and educational needs in the ED and to design and implement a pediatric emergency triage protocol and didactic curriculum based on the World Health Organization's Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment course materials. The triage protocol redefines patient flow, house staff responsibilities, and hospital charting tools in the ED at HIRUDAG. A three-tiered system of triage classification is used with accompanying didactic materials outlining pediatric resuscitation algorithms. Bi-monthly lectures on pediatric emergency triage are delivered to house staff along with pre- and post-tests to evaluate experiences, attitudes, and knowledge of triage principles. Responsibility for facilitating triage education sessions was transitioned to senior residents at HIRUDAG and the chief resident performs regular monitoring of the triage protocol to ensure ongoing quality implementation. Results: Fifty-eight members of the pediatric house staff participated over a 16- month period of training. Initially, 80% of house staff respondents had never been taught principles of triage; 91% felt triage education to be critical to their medical training. Results of pre/post-tests over 16 months indicate that house staff displayed improvement in case-based triage of emergent and urgent patients after the didactic lecture and discussion. Test scores improved from pre/post on both knowledge-based multiple choice questions and case-based decisionmaking questions (pre-test score was 32% vs 78%, P = .03). Additionally, all 58 residents reported increased confidence in triaging patients. Conclusion: The need for a pediatric emergency triage protocol in an academic tertiary care center in the DR was addressed by integrating a newly designed triage protocol and emergency triage curriculum for house staff. A collaborative approach transitioned responsibility for teaching didactic sessions and monitoring the triage protocol to senior residents at HIRUDAG, achieving sustainability of both the protocol and educational initiative. A 16-month review of pre/post surveys indicates statistically significant improvement in house staff's knowledge of emergency triage principles and case-based triage classification. Studies are underway to determine effects on resident triage behaviors in the pediatric ED and clinical outcomes.","L72032749

J.",,eng,,,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent and diversity of involvement of pharmaceutical representatives in emergency medicine residency programs and to assess chief residents' beliefs and attitudes concerning this activity. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A multi-item survey with cover letter was mailed to the chief resident at each of the 87 Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education-approved emergency medicine residency programs in the United States at the time of study conception. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-three percent (72 of 87) of the questionnaires were returned. Ninety-three percent (66 of 71) of responders reported the involvement of pharmaceutical representatives in their emergency medicine residency. The most frequent activities (90%, 63 of 70) were to distribute small gifts (pens, notepads) and to provide meals during department functions such as journal clubs (80%, 56 of 70). Only 32 of 70 responding chief residents (46%) were aware of any established guidelines in their institution or residency program concerning relationships with pharmaceutical representatives, and 14 respondents (20%) believed that accepting gifts from pharmaceutical companies could affect their own prescribing habits. A few stated that pharmaceutical representative-sponsored educational functions were inappropriate. CONCLUSION: The interaction of pharmaceutical representatives with emergency medicine residents and residencies is widespread. More than 50% of the institutions supporting emergency medicine residency programs have no formal guidelines with regard to the interaction of their residents with pharmaceutical representatives or their guidelines are not known to the person most responsible for approval and arrangement of the pharmaceutical representative interaction--the emergency medicine chief resident. While most chief residents believed that accepting small gifts was reasonable, they also believed that accepting gifts valued at $100 or more and pharmaceutical representative sponsorship of trips was inappropriate.","Reeder, M     Dougherty, J     White, L J     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Ann Emerg Med. 1993 Oct;22(10):1593-6.

Each was measured in 10 domains within the scope of OMS. RESULTS: Eighty-four residents (44%) completed the 116-item questionnaire. All respondents were ""very confident"" in their ability to meet the standard of care in mandibular trauma and dentoalveolar surgery. Autonomy was associated with the confidence to meet the standard of care in midface trauma, temporomandibular joint, orthognathic, cosmetic, pathology, reconstructive, and craniofacial surgery. Associations were noted between primary surgeon cases and confidence in midface trauma, temporomandibular joint, orthognathic, cosmetic, and craniofacial surgery. Case numbers were associated with an anticipated frequency of practice within the domains of midface trauma, temporomandibular joint, cosmetic, and pathology surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest an association between a resident's surgical case experience (overall exposure and autonomy) and that resident's future plans for practice and confidence to meet the standard of care in this specialty. OMS training curricula should evolve to incorporate an evaluation of competence and an appropriate transfer of responsibility and experience to residents, thus maximizing confidence and future practice opportunities.","1531-5053     Fillmore, W Jonathan     Teeples, Tyson J     Cha, Stephen     Viozzi, Christopher F     Arce, Kevin     Journal Article     United States     J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2013 Feb;71(2):448-61. doi: 10.1016/j.joms.2012.05.006.

H.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emex&NEWS=N&AN=616550741,,,,"Objective: We explored how frequent low stakes mini-clinical evaluation exercises (mini-CEXs) affect neurology clerkship student perceptions of learning, and to understand student perceptions of these assessments supporting their end of rotation clinical performance evaluations. Background: Direct observation assessments that provide both formative feedback and data for summative clinical competency decisions can be difficult to achieve. The mini-CEX is a widely studied tool of direct observation assessment that provides opportunities for performance feedback. We introduced a new direct observation system with frequent mini-CEXs to jumpstart more opportunities for student learning and to improve our clerkship assessment program. However, students may express resistance to assessments for learning with any summative impact, as they may perceive the assessments as purely a series of summative evaluations. Design/Methods: This qualitative study used a purposeful sampling strategy of two focus groups with third and fourth year medical students who just completed their four week neurology clerkship. All eleven students chose to participate. The majority of students completed eight mini-CEXs with neurology attendings and chief residents, two students completed seven, and one student completed four. Investigator triangulation was used with interpretation comparisons among JM and MF that included independent content analysis. The emerging themes were discussed and reviewed with GHS and final theme consensus was reached. Results: Three major themes arose from the focus groups: perceived effects of frequent mini-CEXs on clerkship student learning by facilitating many opportunities for guided practice under low assessment anxiety, the importance of consistent effective faculty feedback and engagement to maximize mini-CEXs for learning, and support for summative impact of frequent, mainly formative, low stakes mini-CEXs. Conclusions: Students perceived that frequent mini-CEXs are mainly assessments for learning while having summative impact. However, variable perceived faculty affinity and engagement with the mini-CEX is an important consideration to maximize the assessments for learning.","NEW search

rayyan-7444910,A novel approach to interprofessional education (IPE) for residents on an inpatient medical service,2014,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,29,,S502-S503,"Griffith, M. F. and Donaldson, D. and Young, E. A. and Burke, R.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71495942,,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Poor interprofessional communication is the leading cause of medical errors. The quality of communication and collaboration between members of interprofessional teams is associated with patient morbidity. However, few residency programs integrate interprofessional communication training into their inpatient curriculum. Published examples of interprofessional education (IPE) training have focused on pre-clinical medical students, CRM training of operating room staff or resource-heavy TeamSTEPPS events that last multiple hours to multiple days. Few have targeted Internal Medicine residents. Additionally these models tend to focus on communication during the care of a patient in crisis, through high fidelity simulation, rather than the interprofessional communication skills needed to avoid these crises. Our objective was to design an intervention to improve interprofessional collaboration and communication at the primary training site of medical residents, the inpatient medicine ward, that achieved similar outcomes to existing models and required fewer resources. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Denver VA is a 167 bed tertiary care facility. Inpatient housestaff belong to the University of Colorado Internal Medicine resident training program. The residents in the University of Colorado training program rotate through inpatient rotations at four hospitals in the Denver metro area in four-week blocks. The VA was chosen as the site for this teamwork training based on feedback from residents that indicated their communication with nursing was the least successful at this site compared to the others. Nurses in their first year of employment at the VA participate in an on-the-job training program with protected time to participate in quality improvement and patient safety activities. Nurses from this cohort participated in this training during protected education time that coincided with the regularly scheduled resident lunch conference at the Denver VA Hospital. Medical students attending the University of Colorado School of Medicine, as part of their Internal Medicine clerkship at the VA, also took part in the conference. DESCRIPTION: Prior to the conference, a Chief Resident in Quality and Patient Safety and members of nursing education and leadership arranged a one-shift structured shadowing experience for a medicine resident and an RN. This experience allowed both practitioners to observe the daily workflow of the other profession and report back observations regarding barriers to communication and teamwork elucidated by their new perspective. The conference consisted of an introductory discussion of common communication errors between professions, a problem-based learning activity requiring multidisciplinary teamwork, a discussion led by the providers who participated in the shadowing focusing on lessons learned during their experience, and a debriefing focused on specific behaviors both professions could adopt to improve collaboration between professions. EVALUATION: A 5-question survey was distributed to participants before and after the conference, using a 10-point Likert scale (10 = highest) to rate agreement with prompts assessing changes in attitude, understanding of topics presented, and utility of the conference. Although 61 % of participants reported prior training in interprofessional communication, they reported significant increases in their comfort communicating with providers of other professions (before training 7.5, after training 8.0 p<0.01), their ability to identify common causes of communication error (6.9, 7.8 p<0.03), their ability to describe what a practitioner of the other profession does in the hospital (5.2, 7.2 p<0.01) and their ability to involve practitioners of other professions in efforts to improve communication (7.1, 8.1 p<0.01). Practitioners of both professions felt that this conference improved their understanding of interdisciplinary communication and 91 % of participants would highly recommend (score of 8 or higher) this training for their colleagues. We will e aluate resident assessment of nursing at the end of the year to see if this conference, when repeated with different cohorts of residents, improves assessments of VA nursing performance and communication. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Few residency programs integrate IPE into their resident curriculum and fewer still integrate it into the inpatient ward experience where excellent communication between providers is crucial. We have described a novel, one-hour multidisciplinary session requiring few resources that improved providers' self-identified ability to identify and address communication issues between professions and was highly regarded by participants. We anticipate that by repeating this conference regularly we will improve resident and nursing communication at our hospital, enhancing patient safety.","

An Academic Half Day (AHD) dedicated to education in Ambulatory Medicine was implemented in July 2013, 1 year after the introduction of an x + y ambulatory block schedule. In our experience, it was hard to motivate residents to do the required readings, difficult to keep them engaged during the 2.5 h weekly sessions, and challenging to remain excited and enthusiastic as educators. For these reasons, in July 2015 the program transitioned to a Team Based Learning (TBL) format in which the focus was shifted to high yield topics that residents reported having a difficult time with in the clinic. We maintained Evidence Based Medicine sessions, journal clubs and documentation workshops, as well as the requirement for independent study using online ambulatory care modules. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Our residency program (Rutgers New Jersey Medical School) is the largest program in the state, and includes 90 categorical residents across 3 years of training. In the x + y schedule, every 8 weeks of core rotations is followed by 2 weeks in the continuity clinic, such that all categorical residents are exposed to at least five 2-week ambulatory blocks per academic year. Every Friday of the ambulatory block residents must attend the AHD in Ambulatory Medicine. DESCRIPTION: The AHD curriculum spans over the 2 weeks of the ambulatory block, as follows: 1st Friday : TBL1 + Clinical vignette from clinic (group develops question in PICO format) + Workshop (librarian, documentation and coding, substance use disorders) 2nd Friday: TBL 2 + Answers to PICO based on literature review (assigned resident presents) + Journal Club Topics are organized thematically as much as possible (e.g. substance use disorder topics during 1st week are followed by HIV related skin disorders in the second.) Topics are chosen to supplement the online ambulatory care modules which residents are assigned to complete during each block. The TBL sessions include a pre-test based on the assigned reading material, followed by the group application of knowledge to clinical scenarios. We focus on high yield materials that residents report having a difficult time with in the clinic (Dermatology, Diabetes, Obesity, Preoperative evaluation, Substance Use Disorders). The Pre-Test is a short (10 min) quiz, and is followed by 10-15 min of collective review of answers, moderated by the faculty preceptor. The pre-test is used as a way to assess whether residents have read the materials assigned at the beginning of the ambulatory block. It is also a self-assessment of individual knowledge, hence raises interest in the discussion of correct answers. For the TBL session (45-60min), residents are split up into groups of four or five, with residents at each PGY level represented. Complex, case based, multiple choice questions are posed and time is given for each group to discuss internally (team leaders are encouraged to involve interns in the discussion). Questions are purposely vague and often have more than one possible answer. When time for internal debate is up, the team leader raises the answer placard(s) and each team's answers are written on the board. Each answer choice is debated out loud. Points are given for correct answers and for well thought out arguments. The discussion is moderated by the faculty preceptor and the Ambulatory Chief Resident. The tone of the process is 'fun and competitive' but the focus is on knowledge application and clinical teaching points, while winning is secondary. Winners are given token prizes based on the topic at hand (e.g. Pre-Operative Evaluation TBL winners received EKG pins for their white coats.) EVALUATION: The TBL model is engaging and fun for both faculty and the learners. Our residents stay engaged, look forward to the 'soft' competitive nature of the session and are motivated to prepare well so that they can contribute to their team's success. We will compare resident medical knowledge in general internal medicine as reflected by ITE scores in the academic year before and after implementation of the TBL sessions. We also plan to anonymously survey the residents for their satisfaction with this novel method of teaching. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: The team based learning (TBL) model is a successful model of teaching in the undergraduate world, but sparingly used in post graduate medical education. TBL is engaging and fun for both faculty and the residents. It requires more faculty preparation before the sessions compared to the traditional models where learners present assignments. With the exception of session preparation time by faculty, there is minimal additional cost.","L72289567

R. and Kauvar, D. S. and Currier, H. M. and Baskin, T. W. and Pusateri, A. E. and Holcomb, J. B.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: In bleeding patients who are coagulopathic, the clinical response to administration of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) relates to the changes in prothrombin time (PT). DESIGN: Retrospective review of all surgical and trauma patients who were coagulopathic and received factor VIIa at the authors' institution over the past 27 months. SETTING: Academic tertiary referral facility and level I trauma center. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen patients met inclusion criteria, 10 trauma and 8 surgical. Mean age 50 years (range, 17-84). RESULTS: Overall mortality was 39%. All but 1 patient (17/18) had resolution of coagulopathic bleeding with rFVIIa, and all clinical responders (n = 17) (defined as clinical cessation of bleeding within 24 hours determined by either attending surgeon or chief resident progress note) had a decrease in PT to normal range. In contrast, the single clinical nonresponder had an insignificant PT decrease (19 to 18 seconds). Prothrombin time decreased from 20 +/- 4 seconds to 12 +/- 2 seconds, p < 0.05 (n = 17). International Normalized Ratio (INR) decreased from 1.59 to 0.86, p < 0.05 (n = 17). Fibrinogen before administration was 299.73 (range, 105-564) (n = 15). pH before administration was 7.25 (+/-0.18) (n = 10). Patient temperature was 98.64 (+/-2.06). Effect in partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was inconsistent (50 +/- 49 seconds to 34 +/- 6 seconds, p > 0.05). Transfusion requirements for red blood cells (14 to 3 units) and plasma (12 to 3 units) were significantly reduced after rFVIIa. There were no significant differences in percentage PT decrease between dose > or =100 mcg/kg vs <100 mcg/kg, surgical vs trauma patients, survivors vs nonsurvivors, and those with pretreatment platelet count > or =100 K vs <100 K. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of rFVIIa caused a decrease in the PT in nearly all patients. There were an insufficient number of patients to support the use of PT as a clinical predictor of response; however, the data are suggestive of such utility. If the PT does not correct, then it is likely that there is a deficiency of other factors of the coagulation cascade.","McMullin, Neil R     Kauvar, David S     Currier, Heather M     Baskin, Toney W     Pusateri, Anthony E     Holcomb, John B     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2006 Jul-Aug;63(4):246-51.

D. and Dy, C. J. and Patel, R. M. and Blanco, J. S. and Doyle, S. M.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23653022,English,,,"BACKGROUND: The recent emphasis on shared decision-making has increased the role of the Internet as a readily accessible medical reference source for patients and families. However, the lack of professional review creates concern over the quality, accuracy, and readability of medical information available to patients on the Internet. METHODS: Three Internet search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Bing) were evaluated prospectively using 3 difference search terms of varying sophistication (""congenital hip dislocation,"" ""developmental dysplasia of the hip,"" and ""hip dysplasia in children""). Sixty-three unique Web sites were evaluated by each of 3 surgeons (2 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic attendings and 1 orthopaedic chief resident) for quality and accuracy using a set of scoring criteria based on the AAOS/POSNA patient education Web site. The readability (literacy grade level) of each Web site was assessed using the Fleisch-Kincaid score. RESULTS: There were significant differences noted in quality, accuracy, and readability of information depending on the search term used. The search term ""developmental dysplasia of the hip"" provided higher quality and accuracy compared with the search term ""congenital hip dislocation."" Of the 63 total Web sites, 1 (1.6%) was below the sixth grade reading level recommended by the NIH for health education materials and 8 (12.7%) Web sites were below the average American reading level (eighth grade). CONCLUSIONS: The quality and accuracy of information available on the Internet regarding developmental hip dysplasia significantly varied with the search term used. Patients seeking information about DDH on the Internet may not understand the materials found because nearly all of the Web sites are written at a level above that recommended for publically distributed health information. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Physicians should advise their patients to search for information using the term ""developmental dysplasia of the hip"" or, better yet, should refer patients to Web sites that they have personally reviewed for content and clarity. Orthopaedic surgeons, professional societies, and search engines should undertake efforts to ensure that patients have access to information about DDH that is both accurate and easily understandable.","Fabricant, Peter D     Dy, Christopher J     Patel, Ronak M     Blanco, John S     Doyle, Shevaun M     eng     Comparative Study     J Pediatr Orthop. 2013 Jun;33(4):361-5. doi: 10.1097/BPO.0b013e31827d0dd2.

Sixty percent of respondents stated rarely being the primary person to initiate or recommend psychiatry consult for an oncology patient. Respondents' opinions regarding utility of case-based role play were varied with 20% rating it as not very helpful, 60% as helpful, and 20% as very helpful. Conclusions: On the basis of the feedback received from pediatric residents, chief residents and oncology fellows' future directions include (1) modeling language, approaches and skills around delivery of bad news, and difficult conversations. (2) Providing a framework before enacting role plays augmented with relevant materials and articles. (3) Incorporating the perspective and experience of oncology and ICU attendings. (4) Initiating sessions with an introduction to ease the anxiety around role play and decrease perceived awkwardness.","

The following are some recommendations for producing graduates who are effective in protecting communities from environmental hazards and risks: (1) Teach the precautionary principle and its application; (2) Evaluate programs for teaching environmental and occupational health, medicine and epidemiology in schools of public health by their impact on the WHO health indicators and their impact on measures of ecosystem sustainability; (3) Develop problem-oriented projects and give academic credit for projects with definable public health impact and redefine the role of the health officer as the chief resident for Schools of Public Health and Community Medicine; (4) Teach the abuses of child labor and working conditions of women in the workplace and how to prevent the hazards and risks from the more common types of child work; (5) Upgrade teaching of injury prevention and prevention of deaths from external causes; (6) Teach students to recognize the insensitivity of epidemiology as a tool for early detection of true risk; (7) Teach the importance of context in the use of tests of statistical significance; (8) Teach the epidemiologic importance of short latency periods from high exposures as sentinel events for later group risk for cancer and stating the case for action; (9) Protect students and colleagues who are whistleblowers in environmental health from harassment and punishment; (10) Develop curricula and workshops that promote the use of epidemiologic tools for preventing genocide, democide, and their precursors. Schools of Public Health and Community Medicine are at the interface between the resources of academic power and the major problems of community health. Implementing the above recommendations will strengthen academic investigation and impact.","Richter, Elihu D     Berman, Tamar     Journal Article     England     Public Health Rev. 2002;30(1-4):277-92.

O. and Howell, J. D. and Patel, B. P. and Swanson, D. B.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8135980,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The patient-physician relationship is central to medical practice. Increasingly, educators and certifying bodies seek to assess trainees' humanistic qualities. METHOD: The humanistic qualities of first-year internal medicine residents were rated in 1987-88 and 1988-89 by patients hospitalized on the general internal medicine and pulmonary services of the University of Michigan Hospital. Attending physicians (for 1988-89 only), program supervisors (program directors and chief residents), and nurses (for 1988-89 only) rated the same residents, and these ratings were compared with those of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 625 patient questionnaires for 70 residents were analyzed, with a mean of nine patient evaluations per resident and a range from four to 24. Analysis showed that more than 50 patients would need to rate each resident to achieve desired levels of reproducibility. Large numbers of attending physicians (20 to 50) would also be required to obtain a reproducible assessment; the attending physicians' ratings correlated only moderated well (r = .26) with the patients' ratings. Ratings from smaller numbers of program supervisors (five to ten) and nurses (ten to 20) would be needed for reproducible assessments. However, only the nurses' ratings showed a moderately strong relationship (r = .35) with the patients' ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Patients, attending physicians, program supervisors, and nurses view differently the humanistic attributes of residents as they interact with patients. Large numbers of patients and attending physicians would be needed to obtain reproducible ratings. Nurses' and program supervisors' ratings are much more reproducible, but nurses' perceptions correlate more closely to those of patients.","Woolliscroft, J O     Howell, J D     Patel, B P     Swanson, D B     eng     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Acad Med. 1994 Mar;69(3):216-24.

As educators we must adapt to the challenge this presents to education and patient care. We have implemented a monthly grand round session that juxtaposes traditional evidence-based approaches with current, arguably eminence-based, Free Open Access Medical Education (FOAM) for the month's chosen clinical controversy. Using a flipped classroom approach and shared objectives the result is a session that responsibly utilizes traditional and new media to inform clinical decisions. Study Objectives: The primary objective of this educational curriculum is to demonstrate resident proficiency in utilizing primary, secondary, and new forms of medical literature to achieve evidence-based practice opinions on clinical controversies. Additional objectives include demonstrating the ability to evaluate the strength of evidence based on evidence type and to communicate evidence-based opinions in an open format. Methods: Residents are introduced to evidence-based medicine and FOAM early in the curriculum through intern orientation, winter research symposium, and grand rounds. These resources are augmented by access to hospital library resources and residency association memberships for each resident to facilitate discussion at these sessions. This session exercises those skills to answer a controversial question. One or two clinical questions are chosen based on relevance to the block theme, controversy, and feasibility. Chief Residents choose class leaders to ensure predictability and to guide discussion. Senior emergency residents read and summarize critical and controversial primary literature. Second-year residents review FOAM for the most recent opinions. First-year residents obtain relevant review articles and applicable clinical guidelines. Each individual resident will come prepared to present 2 to 3 articles or FOAM-informed opinions. The discussion is guided by a Rules of the Game which encourages debate and minimizes anecdotes. Discussion can be facilitated by a game show template or debate format with Pro and Con teams. The facilitator accesses the relevant article or FOAM Web sites real-time for detailed discussion. Residents are evaluated on their presentation, as well as a worksheet completed pre- and post-session that guides them through evidence-based decision making. Conclusion: This innovative educational module engages the resident directly into forming evidence-based opinions and enables them to access the most recent trends in thought. FOAM is presented in an environment where both staff and residents are armed with their own detailed research that can shape interpretations. Residents present 20-30 references in each session and can quickly become experts in the topic area. FOAM searches stimulate valuable discussions that would be missed in a standard educational model. The module format is constantly updating and directions for growth include residency wiki site, PI projects and publications tied directly from the work.","

Methods: In a cross-sectional antegrade study, 200 patient who had come with acute abdominal pain to Modarres hospital emergency room, Tehran, Iran, in 12 months were enrolled; the data of 181 patient were complete that was relevant to our study. Alvarado and modified Alvarado scales were used for data collection by the chief resident of surgery. Pathology report was the standard criterion in this survey. Findings: The accuracy of modified Alvarado score in diagnosis of appendicitis was 81.4% in comparison with 74.0% of Alvarado score. Our modified score with the sensitivity of 88.0% (vs. 67.7%) and the same specificity of 64.4% in detecting normal cases and positive predicting value (PPV) of 66.0% (vs. 41.9%) in diagnosis of acute appendicitis and positive predicting value of 87.3% (vs. 84.1%) in cases of score of more than of 6 was a better score compare to Alvarado score. Conclusion: Adding abdominal pain, male gender, and qualitative C-reactive protein (CRP) to Alvarado score was resulted in obtaining a higher accuracy in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.","

G. and Kuhel, W. I.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: Tracheotomy for long-term ventilation is a common surgical procedure in the hospital setting. Although the postoperative care is often perceived as routine, complications associated with tracheostomy changes may result in loss of airway and death. In addition, the practice patterns, rationale, and complications related to tube changes have been poorly described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A survey of chief residents in accredited otolaryngology training programs was performed to determine the management strategies, rationale, and complications associated with postoperative tracheostomy tube changes. RESULTS: The first tube change was performed after a mean of 5.3 (range, 3-7) days after the procedure, most frequently by junior residents. The first change was performed in a variety of locations including the intensive care unit (88%), step down unit (80%), and regular floor (78%). Twenty-five percent performed these changes at night or on weekends. The most frequently reported rationale for performing routine tracheotomy changes was examination of the stoma for maturity (46%), prevention of stomal infection (46%), and confirmation of stability for transport to a less monitored setting (41%). Twenty-five (42%) respondents reported awareness of a loss of airway, and nine (15%) respondents reported awareness of a death as a result of the first tube change at their institution during their residency. A statistically significant higher incidence of airway loss was reported by respondents who reported performing the first tube change on the floor (96.1% vs. 63.6%). CONCLUSION: There is significant variability in the approach to postoperative tracheostomy tube management. The occurrence of major complications including deaths from routine tube changes requires an examination of the rationale and safety of this practice.","Tabaee, Abtin     Lando, Tali     Rickert, Scott     Stewart, Michael G     Kuhel, William I     Journal Article     United States     Laryngoscope. 2007 Apr;117(4):573-6. doi: 10.1097/MLG.0b013e318030455a.

Technical ability was assessed with the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery examination performance. Teaching ability was assessed with medical student evaluations on a 9-point Likert scale as well as with receipt of teaching awards: The Arnold P. Gold Teaching Award, the surgical teaching award given by each graduating class of the medical school, and resident induction into Alpha Omega Alpha. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed between resident groups based on teaching award status and Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery examination outcomes, using an alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: For 32 chief residents (7 female), the median score on the Manual Skills Section was 531 (interquartile range [IQR] [478-563]).

J.",,,,,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this project is to document the history of the Fellowship Council (FC) and report its current impact on surgical training. The need for advanced training in laparoscopic surgery resulted in the rapid development of fellowships for which there was no oversight. Fellowship program directors began meeting in the 1990s and formally created the FC in 2004 to provide that oversight. METHODS: To obtain information with which to create a narrative of the history of the FC, the authors performed a detailed review of all available minutes from the meetings of the various iterations of the council and its committees between 2001 and 2012. Information about fellowships and meetings of the directors of fellowships prior to 2001 are based on information included in minutes of meetings after 2001. RESULTS: Minimally invasive surgery fellowship program directors in collaboration with surgical societies created the FC to bring order to the application process for residents and program directors. It has evolved into an organization with mature, reliable processes for application, matching, curriculum development, accreditation, and reporting. It now receives applications from more than 30 % of graduating chief residents in general surgery. It has 223 accredited fellowship positions in the following disciplines: Minimally invasive surgery, bariatric/metabolic surgery, Flexible endoscopy, hepato-pancreato-biliary Surgery, colorectal surgery, and Thoracic surgery.

18439528,Narrative medicine in surgical education,2008,1,1,J Surg Educ,1878-7452,65,2,99-100,"Pearson, A. S. and McTigue, M. P. and Tarpley, J. L.",,,,,"PURPOSE: Narrative medicine is a patient-centered approach to the practice of medicine that rescues the patients' stories and integrates what is important to them into decisions regarding their health care. Our hypothesis is that narrative understanding enhances the patient-provider relationship and contributes to optimizing patient care. We propose to use written narrative reflection to capture and measure the general competencies of systems-based practice, practice-based learning, communication skills, and professionalism. DEVELOPMENT/METHODS: The development of this narrative-based project is based on a pilot study that we conducted at our institution with third-year surgical clerkship students. In the pilot, students produced in-depth narrative write-ups on a patient they had had the opportunity to ""know."" We plan a similar approach for surgical resident education. After a brief discussion of narrative medicine during our scheduled didactic conference, the residents are asked to initiate a written narrative reflection on a patient of their choosing. The narratives will be collected 1 week later. Our plan is to repeat this assessment quarterly so that 4 narratives will be generated annually from internship through the chief resident year. EVALUATION: The narratives will be analyzed for content and recurring themes that capture the resident's communication skills, professionalism, as well as self-critique (practice-based learning) and value attributed to health-care teams (systems-based practice). OUTCOME MEASURES: After completion of the narratives, a 5-point Likert response survey will be given to the residents to assess their experience and the perceived value of written reflection. The written narratives will become part of the resident's ongoing portfolio. IMPLEMENTATION/EXPERIENCE TO DATE: Feedback from the medical student pilot study was favorable. When asked in a follow-up questionnaire, most students reported the experience to be valuable and recommended the use of narrative reflection in medical education. To assess the feasibility of this approach in surgical residency, we introduced the concept of narrative reflection to our residents during surgery grand rounds. Thirty-three narratives were collected 1 week later. CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS: This preliminary experience suggests that acquisition of resident-authored narrative reflection is feasible during surgical residency. Use of this narrative-based approach in surgical resident education has the potential to capture and measure the general competencies of systems-based practice, practice-based learning, communication skills, and professionalism.","Pearson, A Scott McTigue, Michael P Tarpley, John L Journal Article United States J Surg Educ. 2008 Mar-Apr;65(2):99-100. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2007.11.008.

While I was green enough at the beginning of my clinical clerkships to believe that most of my medical education would happen at the bedside, at that moment, I was learning another important fact: a large part of my ethical education was going to happen behind the closed doors of a call room. The health care team was polluted by a pervasive atmosphere of frustration, as silent but tangible as a thick layer of fog, that obscured the patient's ability to evaluate the consequences of the choice that lay before her. The attending did not permit, let alone create, an environment that provided room for dissent. Institutions should encourage the leaders of clinical education to foster an emotionally safer learning environment in which honest moral dialogue may occur without fear of repercussions. If students cannot learn to apply the principles of ethics actively throughout their clerkships, it will be much harder to do so when they practice independently, and ultimately, patient care will suffer. Conversely, when students and trainees are empowered by their teachers, patient care improves.","Yerramilli, Divya Journal Article United States Hastings Cent Rep. 2014 Sep;44(5):30-2. doi: 10.1002/hast.355.

The interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities of these measurements have not been evaluated. METHODS: Three groups of observers with different levels of experience (5 attending pediatric orthopaedic surgeons, 5 orthopaedic chief residents, and 5 interns) measured the LDFA, MPTA, and MAD on 35 full-length standing anteroposterior teleroentgenograms (56extremities). Relatively equal numbers of extremities with varus, valgus, and normal alignments were chosen to represent a spectrum of lower extremities that might be encountered clinically. Measurements were performed in random order by each observer on 2 separate occasions separated by at least 2 weeks. RESULTS: The interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities for each of the measurements regardless of the level of experience was greater than or equal to 0.90. The interobserver differences were slightly greater than the intraobserver differences for all measurements. The overall mean interobserver differences for angular and MAD measurements were within 1.6 degrees and 3.1 mm, respectively. The overall mean intraobserver differences for angular and MAD measurements were within 1.4 degrees and 1.9 mm, respectively. Reliability and mean differences were consistent regardless of the level of experience.

The survey serves as a tool for observing trends and disseminating ideas among radiology programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey conducted through the SurveyMonkey Web site was distributed to chief residents from 187 Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited radiology training programs. A variety of multiple-choice and free-response questions were designed to gather information about residency program details, benefits, chief resident responsibilities, call, preparations for the recent American Board of Radiology Core Examination, implementation of selectives (mini-fellowships), fellowships, health care economics and the job market, and ACGME milestones. RESULTS: Among those surveyed, 212 unique responses from 136 programs were provided, yielding a 73% response rate. Data were compared to historical data from prior surveys dating back through 2002. CONCLUSIONS: Programs are increasingly providing 24-hour sonographer coverage, full day routine services on weekends, and 24-hour attending radiologist coverage. The new American Board of Radiology examination format and schedule has driven many changes, including when chief residents serve, board preparation and review, and how the final year of residency training is structured. Despite facing many changes, there is slightly more optimism among chief residents regarding their future job prospects.","1878-4046     Shetty, Anup     Hammer, Mark     Gould, Jennifer     Evens, Ronald     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 2014 Oct;21(10):1331-47. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2014.05.010.

D. and Phitayakorn, R.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Although barriers to granting surgical residents autonomy in the operating room are well described, few have proposed practical strategies to overcome these barriers. Our department adopted a multidisciplinary approach to develop a rotation that aimed to grant chief residents structured operative autonomy. In this study, we assess the feasibility of implementation, impact on patient safety, and educational benefit to residents after the program's pilot year. STUDY DESIGN: During a 1-month rotation, chief residents began cases alone using their own operative block time. The attending surgeon was notified when the critical portion of the operation was reached and supervised its completion. Postoperative complications, intraoperative adverse events, readmissions, operation duration, and length of stay in a subset of patients that underwent a cholecystectomy or appendectomy were compared with patients operated on by standard resident services. Follow-up surveys were administered to residents 1 year after graduation. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four operations, which ranged in complexity, were performed by chief residents. Unadjusted subset analysis comparing the structured operative autonomy (n = 54) and standard resident (n = 718) services outcomes for appendectomies and cholecystectomies revealed no significant differences in 30-day postoperative complications (5.6% vs 4.0%; p = 0.59), major intraoperative adverse events, or readmissions (3.7% vs 3.8%; p = 1.00), respectively. Multivariate analysis performed for 30-day complications (odds ratio 0.8; 95% CI 0.2 to 3.2; p = 0.76) and readmissions (odds ratio 0.4; 95% CI 0.1 to 2.1; p = 0.3) corroborated unadjusted findings. All participants (n = 8) strongly agreed that the rotation eased their transition to fellowship or independent practice. CONCLUSIONS: Structured operative autonomy overcomes known barriers to granting chief residents autonomy in the operating room. When used for select general surgery cases, resident education is enhanced without impacting patient outcomes. This training model has the potential to improve the surgical independence of graduating residents.","1879-1190     Wojcik, Brandon M     Fong, Zhi Ven     Patel, Madhukar S     Chang, David C     Long, Dustin R     Kaafarani, Haytham M A     Petrusa, Emil     Mullen, John T     Lillemoe, Keith D     Phitayakorn, Roy     Journal Article     United States     J Am Coll Surg. 2017 Dec;225(6):713-724.e2. doi: 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2017.08.015.

Pediatric residency education guidelines suggest incorporating sports medicine (SM) education into curricula; however, research is lacking regarding effective teaching methods. OBJECTIVE: To assess reported US pediatric residency SM curricula, teaching methods, and resident evaluation of SM education. DESIGN/METHODS: Chief residents (CRs) and third-year residents (PL3s) from 100 randomly selected US Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited residency programs, stratified by size and geographic location, received surveys regarding programs' SM curriculum and teaching methods and individuals' methods for learning SM. RESULTS: Response rates were 63% and 39% for CRs and PL3s, respectively. According to CRs, 34% of programs had no one in charge of their SM curriculum. Lecture (77%) was the primary method used for teaching SM. Hands-on teaching (37%) was used less frequently. CRs stated that 29% of programs did not include musculoskeletal examination teaching in their curriculums; 24% did not include formal teaching of concussion management, and 29% did not include reasons for medical disqualification. PL3s rated teaching of joint examinations and the preparticipation physical as the most poorly taught components of the physical examination. PL3s rated hands-on teaching and patient experience as the best methods for improving SM education. CRs reported that only 36% of programs have discussed incorporating more SM into their curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: SM education is deficient in US pediatric residency programs. Standardized curricula should be developed with a focus on hands-on training as a means for teaching SM to pediatric residents.","Demorest, Rebecca A Bernhardt, David T Best, Thomas M Landry, Gregory L

F. and Pontinen, T. and Lender, P. A.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Stress radiography provides an objective tool to measure posterior knee instability. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability has been reported for the Telos device, but it has not been studied using the kneeling technique. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to evaluate the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of measurements made using kneeling stress radiography to quantify posterior knee instability. STUDY DESIGN: Case series (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: One hundred thirty-two stress radiographs in 44 patients with suspected posterior knee instability were prospectively taken using the kneeling technique. The amount of posterior displacement on the radiographs was then measured independently by 3 blinded testers (an orthopaedic sports medicine faculty member, an orthopaedic chief resident, and a medical student) on 2 separate occasions. Changes in mean and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were examined to assess the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the measurements. RESULTS: Intraobserver changes in displacement means were small (-0.307 mm, -0.294 mm, and +0.035 mm) and only significant for observer 1. The combined intraobserver ICC was 0.973 for the 3 observers (0.976, 0.959, and 0.981). Interobserver comparisons revealed significant differences in trial 1 between observers 2 and 3 (0.675 mm), no differences in trial 2, and significant differences between observers 1 and 2 (0.333 mm) and observers 2 and 3 (0.510 mm) in the combined trial data. The combined interobserver ICC was 0.955 for the 3 observers (0.959 and 0.951 for the 2 trials). CONCLUSIONS: The kneeling technique for posterior cruciate ligament stress radiography provides a reproducible method to quantify posterior knee instability.","1552-3365     Jackman, Todd     LaPrade, Robert F     Pontinen, Thomas     Lender, Paul A     Journal Article     United States     Am J Sports Med. 2008 Aug;36(8):1571-6. doi: 10.1177/0363546508315897.

14972300,The Leapfrog Initiative: a potential threat to surgical education,2003,1,1,Curr Surg,0149-7944 (Print)     0149-7944,60,2,218-21,"Barone, J. E. and Tucker, J. B. and Bull, S. M.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: The Leapfrog Initiative was established in January 2000 by the Business Roundtable (BRT) in response to the Institute of Medicine report on quality and safety of medical care. The BRT is composed of chief executive officers of U.S. corporations representing more than 28 million employees. Leapfrog has proposed 3 hospital safety measures-computerized physician order entry, intensive care unit physician staffing standards and evidence-based hospital referral, which states that hospitals must meet certain volume/year criteria. Three of these criteria are pertinent to general surgery. They are abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair greater than or equal to 30/year, carotid endarterectomy (CE) greater than or equal to 100/year, and esophageal cancer surgery (ECS) greater than or equal to 7/year. Hospitals failing to meet these requirements would not be eligible to treat patients employed by BRT corporations. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Residency Review Committee (RRC) for Surgery Resident Statistics Summary for 1999 to 2001. Comparisons were made between the numbers of the Leapfrog index cases required and the actual number of cases performed by each graduating chief resident. Data from the Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA) for fiscal year 2000 were also analyzed. Outcomes for procedures at The Stamford Hospital were reviewed. RESULTS: Data obtained from the RRC reveal that the mode numbers for each of the 3 evidence-based standards for each graduating chief resident in 2000 and 2001 are 5 and 3 for AAA, 15 and 17 for CE, and 0 in both years for ECS. Extrapolation using the mode for each procedure reveals that hospitals with 5 or 6 graduating chief residents may be ineligible to treat patients for AAA and CE. Hospitals with less than or equal to 5 chief residents would be excluded from performing CE. Very few institutions are performing adequate numbers of ECS. Only 4 of 31 CT hospitals would be allowed to perform AAA, and only 3 of 31 could perform CE. Only 1 Connecticut hospital performed more than 7 ECS cases in FY 2000. It is apparent that Leapfrog standards will have serious economic impact on many hospitals, as well as displacing patients to other cities for care. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical chairs and program directors should be aware of the Leapfrog standards and assess their own programs and institutions for compliance. Performance improvement and outcomes data for all evidence-based standards should be reviewed.","Barone, James E     Tucker, James B     Bull, Sherman M     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2003 Mar-Apr;60(2):218-21. doi: 10.1016/S0149-7944(02)00684-0.

J. and Bragg, D. and Simpson, D.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To test a 360-degree resident evaluation tool on our trauma/critical care services to determine if multiple raters yielded equivalent information compared with traditional faculty evaluations. DESIGN: Prospective evaluation. PARTICIPANTS: Residents, nurses, faculty, and staff at an academic medical center. METHODS: The evaluation tool was developed based on extensive qualitative analysis of 13 major medical specialties' Residency Review Committee (RRC) criteria relative to the ACGME competencies and then revised with content specific to surgery. The evaluation contained 19 items divided into ACGME competency areas. Each item was scored on a 1 to 9 Likert scale: 1 = not meeting expectations and 9 = exceeding expectations. Residents on the trauma and surgical intensive care unit rotations evaluated themselves, and they were also evaluated by chief residents, surgical intensive care unit fellows, faculty, surgical intensive care unit nurses, trauma nurse clinicians, and nurse practitioners. Multiple analyses of variance were used to compare ratings by rater groups. RESULTS: Ten residents were evaluated on the trauma service from April to August 2003. Between 74 and 106 evaluations were obtained per resident per competency area. Average scores across the competencies were remarkably similar, ranging from 6.18 for practice-based learning and systems-based practice to 6.54 for professionalism. Although there was variability within rater groups, ratings were not statistically different between groups for any ACGME competency. CONCLUSIONS: The 360-degree evaluation provide limited new information compared with traditional faculty ratings. Follow-up studies are required to confirm this finding with larger samples of residents and surgical specialties.","Weigelt, John A     Brasel, Karen J     Bragg, Dawn     Simpson, Deborah     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2004 Nov-Dec;61(6):616-26; discussion 627-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cursur.2004.06.024.

M. and Chaudhry, S. and Halvorsen, A. and Schauer, D. and Thomas, K. and McDonald, F. S.",,eng,,,"THEORY: Networking has positive effects on career development; however, personal characteristics of group members such as gender or diversity may foster or hinder member connectedness. Social network analysis explores interrelationships between people in groups by measuring the strength of connection between all possible pairs in a given network. Social network analysis has rarely been used to examine network connections among members in an academic medical society. This study seeks to ascertain the strength of connection between program directors in the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) and its Education Innovations Project subgroup and to examine possible associations between connectedness and characteristics of program directors and programs. HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that connectedness will be measurable within a large academic medical society and will vary significantly for program directors with certain measurable characteristics (e.g., age, gender, rank, location, burnout levels, desire to resign). METHOD: APDIM program directors described levels of connectedness to one another on the 2012 APDIM survey. Using social network analysis, we ascertained program director connectedness by measuring out-degree centrality, in-degree centrality, and eigenvector centrality, all common measures of connectedness. RESULTS: Higher centrality was associated with completion of the APDIM survey, being in a university-based program, Educational Innovations Project participation, and higher academic rank. Centrality did not vary by gender; international medical graduate status; previous chief resident status; program region; or levels of reported program director burnout, callousness, or desire to resign. CONCLUSIONS: In this social network analysis of program directors within a large academic medical society, we found that connectedness was related to higher academic rank and certain program characteristics but not to other program director characteristics like gender or international medical graduate status. Further research is needed to optimize our understanding of connection in organizations such as these and to determine which strategies promote valuable connections.","1532-8015     Warm, Eric     ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6088-2434     Arora, Vineet M     Chaudhry, Saima     Halvorsen, Andrew     Schauer, Daniel     Thomas, Kris     McDonald, Furman S     Journal Article     United States     Teach Learn Med. 2018 Mar 22:1-8. doi: 10.1080/10401334.2018.1441715.

A.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Exposure to blood-borne diseases remains an occupational risk. Mandates have improved training in how to report exposures for all health-care workers. How exposure rates of surgical residents correlate with experience and mandatory training to reduce risk is not known. It was hypothesized that enhanced training would result in an increased reporting of exposures by surgical trainees and that risk would be greater in the first years of training. DESIGN: Retrospective review of occupational health records and operative case logs, prospective survey. METHODS: Occupational Health Services provides both initial and annual training to General Surgery house staff at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Initial training consists of a blood-borne pathogen review and a detailed explanation of exposure reporting. Mandatory annual training is provided during Surgical Grand Rounds. Training was enhanced beginning June 2005 using a videotape outlining surgical risks and specific countermeasures. The numbers of reported exposures per year before and after enhanced training were compared. Exposures were self-reported. As most exposures occurred in the operating room, rate of exposure was calculated for each year of training using the total number of cases done each year reported by the general surgical residents. RESULTS: Surgical residents reported 118 needlestick injuries over 6 years. Senior and chief residents demonstrated a significantly lower exposure rate than junior residents (nonparametric Mood's median test, p < 0.0001). No significant difference in the injury rate was found per 1000 cases after enhanced training. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing surgical experience lowered the needlestick injury rate. Assuming no change in self-reporting rates by year, enhanced training and reporting guidelines did not seem to change risk. More specific training for junior residents, as well as passive prevention solutions, may be necessary to positively impact their exposure risk.","Brasel, Karen J     Mol, Christopher     Kolker, Alex     Weigelt, John A     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2007 Nov-Dec;64(6):395-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2007.04.003.

Programs in Graduate Medical Education provide inconsistent and limited exposure to formal leadership development experiences for physicians in their final year of residency training. Literature addressing leadership training for residents focuses on the scarcity of effective programs that deliver adequate training and provide measurable outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore how chief medical and surgical residents develop leadership awareness and experience training in leadership and engage chief residents, faculty mentors, and program administrators in a collaborative process, developing a leadership training model within an independent (non-academic) residency training program. To understand the residents and the institutional experience in this realm, focused interviews were conducted with chief residents from Family Medicine and Surgery, faculty mentors, program administrators, and regional subject matter experts. Professional identity development of the residents was investigated and related to their experiences. Action research was the framework for this study due to the iterative and participative nature of the methods. Subsequent to the interviews, outgoing and incoming chief residents engaged in collaborative sessions during which peak leadership experiences were discussed. The outcomes of the sessions and analysis of the interviews were discussed with the program directors for future consideration of curriculum change. The findings indicated a change in leadership awareness among chief residents demonstrating that stimulus and subsequent reflection prompted the residents to review their roles as leaders, seeking opportunities to apply leadership awareness to their daily work. In order to teach and role model leadership, training has to be implemented that interposes the same rigor as in clinical training. Experiential opportunities for leadership training exist that are not utilized. Conflict exists between the financial contribution of the chief residents and time allocated to training. Relationship and reflection were identified as the common threads through identity, leadership, education, and organizational behavior. A pilot program training surgical chief residents in the relational model of palliative care and leadership is underway as a catalytic effect of this study.

This article reveals how a structured leadership program was developed so that residents are better prepared for the role of chief resident and future leadership roles. Beginning in October 2006, residents attended a series of 1-hour workshops conducted monthly. Topics included leadership style, conflict management, effective feedback, team building, team leadership, motivation, and moving from peer to leader. A retrospective pretest was conducted at the end of the program. Residents reported a significant knowledge gain for the majority of topics. Resident comments indicated a greater awareness of the impact of leading and ways to improve their personal leadership. Quantitatively and qualitatively, residents and faculty reported that the leadership program made a significant impact on the development of future neurosurgical leaders.","Pettit, Jeffrey E     Dahdaleh, Nader S     Albert, Gregory W     Greenlee, Jeremy D

27906760,Improving the Quality of Ward-based Surgical Care With a Human Factors Intervention Bundle,2018,1,1,Ann Surg,0003-4932 (Print) 0003-4932,267,1,73-80,"Johnston, M. J. and Arora, S. and King, D. and Darzi, A.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the impact of a human factors intervention bundle on the quality of ward-based surgical care in a UK hospital. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Improving the culture of a surgical team is a difficult task. Engagement with stakeholders before intervention is key. Studies have shown that appropriate supervision can enhance surgical ward safety. METHODS: A pre-post intervention study was conducted. The intervention bundle consisted of twice-daily attending ward rounds, a ""chief resident of the week"" available at all times on the ward, an escalation of care protocol and team contact cards. Twenty-seven junior and senior surgeons completed validated questionnaires assessing supervision, escalation of care, and safety culture pre and post-intervention along with interviews to further explore the impact of the intervention. Patient outcomes pre and postintervention were also analyzed. RESULTS: Questionnaires revealed significant improvements in supervision postintervention (senior median pre 5 vs post 7, P = 0.002 and junior 4 vs 6, P = 0.039) and senior surgeon approachability (junior 5 vs 6, P = 0.047). Both groups agreed that they would feel safer as a patient in their hospital postintervention (senior 3 vs 4.5, P = 0.021 and junior 3 vs 4, P = 0.034). The interviews confirmed that the safety culture of the department had improved. There were no differences in inpatient mortality, cardiac arrest, reoperation, or readmission rates pre and postintervention. CONCLUSION: Improving supervision and introducing clear protocols can improve safety culture on the surgical ward. Future work should evaluate the effect these measures have on patient outcomes in multiple institutions.","1528-1140     Johnston, Maximilian J     Arora, Sonal     King, Dominic     Darzi, Ara     Journal Article     United States     Ann Surg. 2018 Jan;267(1):73-80. doi: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002089.

The purpose of this study was to determine the attitudes of nurses and pediatric residents towards adolescents and young adults with ED. METHODS: Nursing questionnaires were distributed through a nurse manager and resident questionnaires were distributed in coordination with the chief residents. RESULTS: A total of 82 individuals (32 nurses and 50 pediatric residents) completed the survey. Only two nurses and six residents had not worked with a patient with an ED in the previous year. The vast majority of nurses and residents recognized that fear of gaining weight, refusal to maintain body weight and, disturbed body image were frequent signs occurring in patients with an ED. Both nurses and residents believed that emotional problems, influence of friends and family, family pressure, influence of the media, and being self-induced were the most likely causes of EDs. Genetics and influence of other medical problems were deemed less likely causes. The majority of residents identified having different rules for different patients and poor communication as factors that make it difficult to take care of ED patients. More than half of all nurses and residents (58.2%) thought that ED patients were responsible for their disease ""always"" or ""in most cases"". Residents (68.8%) were more likely than nurses (45.2%) to frequently feel frustrated with ED patients (chi2, p<0.0370).

B. and Shealy, C. and Senkowski, C.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires residents to be trained in practice-based learning and improvement as well as systems-based practice. In an effort to establish a formal curriculum for graduate medical education, a Performance Improvement (PI) Training Program was initiated at Memorial University Medical Center. Training for the chief residents across all residency programs focused on the basic Six Sigma framework. Chief residents chose faculty sponsors and were also mentored by Six Sigma-trained staff. Faculty and physicians who participated in the initiative received PI/Continuing Medical Education credit. METHODS: A total of 17 presurveys and postsurveys were completed on 7 outcome measures. Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank 2-tailed tests were performed to test for significant change from presurvey to postsurvey. RESULTS: Analysis of the 2-year data (2009-2011) found statistically significant improvement for all 7 outcome measures. The surgical residents' PI Project for 2011 included the development of the Venous Thromboembolism Reassessment Tool. The project included a multidisciplinary team to develop a computer prompt that continued to trigger if the physician launched the prophylaxis or treatment form without ordering anticoagulation. The new prompt resulted in a 391% increase in anticoagulant orders. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the resident-based PI Training Program was innovative, practical, and comprehensive. Education, tools, and skill development were provided on quality and PI theory and practice for resident physicians in support of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies of professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, and systems-based practice.","1878-7452     Miller, Nessa     MacNew, Heather     Nester, Jane     Wiggins, Jean B     Shealy, Cynthia     Senkowski, Christopher     Journal Article     Review     United States     J Surg Educ. 2013 Nov-Dec;70(6):758-68. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2013.06.016.

If intubation is required for more than two to four weeks, an elective tracheostomy is usually indicated. Transferring these patients to the operating room is difficult, and it impairs their continued monitoring and care. Over a period of 48 months at our institution, 74 patients had tracheostomy done in the intensive care unit (ICU) by a surgical resident (PG2 level) assisted by a chief resident or attending faculty member. Local anesthesia was supplemented with intravenous sedatives, and operating room technique was used, with complete surgical instrument pack and adequate lighting. There were no deaths from the procedure. There were no complications specifically attributed to the performance of tracheostomy in the ICU, though one patient each suffered tracheitis, tracheostomy tube dislodgement, and tracheomalacia. Tracheostomy in the ICU avoids the risks of moving these patients with all their monitoring and infusion lines, and saves operating room time and charges. Trained surgical personnel using adequate instruments and lighting can safely perform a tracheostomy in the intensive care unit.","Hawkins, M L     Burrus, E P     Treat, R C     Mansberger, A R Jr     Journal Article     United States     South Med J. 1989 Sep;82(9):1096-8.

29634310,A Survey of Patient Care Handoff and Sign-Out Practices Among Podiatric Surgical Residency Programs,2018,1,1,J Am Podiatr Med Assoc,8750-7315 (Print) 1930-8264,108,2,151-157,"Sansosti, L. E. and Crowell, A. and Ellis-McConnell, W. and Meyr, A. J.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: A patient ""handoff,"" or the ""sign-out"" process, is an episode during which the responsibility of a patient transitions from one health-care provider to another. These are important events that affect patient safety, particularly because a significant proportion of adverse events have been associated with a relative lack of physician communication. The objective of this investigation was to survey podiatric surgical residency programs with respect to patient care handoff and sign-out practices. METHODS: A survey was initially developed and subsequently administered to the chief residents of 40 Council on Podiatric Medical Education-approved podiatric surgical residency programs attempting to elucidate patient care handoff protocols and procedures and on-call practices. RESULTS: Although it was most common for patient care handoffs to occur in person (60.0%), programs also reported that handoffs regularly occurred by telephone (52.5%) and with no direct personal communication whatsoever other than the electronic passing of information (50.0%). In fact, 27.5% of programs reported that their most common means of patient care handoff was without direct resident communication and was instead purely electronic. We observed that few residents reported receiving formal education or assessment/feedback (17.5%) regarding their handoff proficiency, and only 5.0% of programs reported that attending physicians regularly took part in the handoff/sign-out process. Although most programs felt that their sign-out practices were safe and effective, 67.5% also believed that their process could be improved. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide unique information on a potentially underappreciated aspect of podiatric medical education and might point to some common deficiencies regarding the development of interprofessional communication within our profession during residency training.","1930-8264     Sansosti, Laura E     Crowell, Amanda     Ellis-McConnell, Whitney     Meyr, Andrew J     Journal Article     United States     J Am Podiatr Med Assoc. 2018 Mar;108(2):151-157. doi: 10.7547/16-094.

28287827,Intensive Care Unit Educators: A Multicenter Evaluation of Behaviors Residents Value in Attending Physicians,2017,1,1,Ann Am Thorac Soc,2325-6621,14,4,513-516,"Santhosh, L. and Jain, S. and Brady, A. and Sharp, M. and Carlos, W. G.",,eng,,,"RATIONALE: It is important for attending physicians to know which behaviors influence learner perceptions. To date, two studies focusing on general medicine attending physicians have been published addressing internal medicine residents' perceptions of attending physicians; there are no data on intensive care unit (ICU) attending physicians. OBJECTIVES: We sought to expand the evidence regarding this topic through a multicenter study at four geographically diverse academic medical centers. Our study focused on identifying the teaching behaviors of ICU physicians that learners observe in attending physicians who they value as effective educators. METHODS: The study was conducted at Indiana University (Indianapolis, IN), Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD), University of California-San Francisco (San Francisco, CA), and University of Washington (Seattle, WA). Internal medicine residents completed an anonymous online survey rating the importance of behaviors of ICU attending physician role models. We created a 37-item questionnaire derived from prior studies and from the Clinician Teaching Program from the Stanford Faculty Development Center for Medical Teachers. This questionnaire included behaviors, current and past, that residents observed in their ICU attending physicians. RESULTS: A total of 260 of 605 residents responded to the survey (overall response rate of 43%). The five behaviors of attending physicians most commonly rated as ""very important"" to residents were: (1) enjoyment of teaching; (2) demonstrating empathy and compassion to patients and families; (3) ability to explain clinical reasoning and differential diagnoses; (4) treating nonphysician staff members respectfully; and (5) enthusiasm on rounds. Behaviors that trainees rated as less important were having numerous research publications, having served as chief resident, sharing personal life with residents, and organizing end-of-rotation social events. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new information to attending physicians striving to influence resident education. Although prior data demonstrated that learners valued attending physicians having served as chief resident and sharing personal information with learners, our study did not replicate this. We confirmed that learners appreciated teachers who are perceived to enjoy teaching. We discovered that behaviors, such as expression of empathy, explanation of clinical reasoning, and qualities of professionalism, were commonly seen in esteemed teaching attending physicians. Our study was limited by lack of correlation to objective performance metrics and a low response rate. Future work may include assessing the impact of faculty development on identified behaviors.","2325-6621     Santhosh, Lekshmi     ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9897-3462     Jain, Snigdha     Brady, Anna     Sharp, Michelle     Carlos, W Graham     Journal Article     Multicenter Study     United States     Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2017 Apr;14(4):513-516. doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201612-996BC.

S. and Disbot, M. and Wurster, A. and Mullen, J. L. and Kaiser, L. R. and Morris, J. B.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the relationship between resident performance and patient satisfaction. To this end, our institution added housestaff-specific questions to Press-Ganey surveys (Press-Ganey, South Bend, Indiana) administered to patients. This study sought to investigate the impact residents have on patients' overall rating of care compared with faculty and nursing staff. Our hypothesis was that residents play an important but historically underappreciated role in patient satisfaction. METHODS: Between April 2005 and June 2006, half of all discharged patients randomly received Press-Ganey surveys, including questions on the following categories: admissions, patient room, food, diagnostic testing, guest services, faculty/attending physician, discharge, emotional needs, housestaff, nurse practitioners, and primary nurse. responses were grouped into overall category scores and used as predictor variables for regression analysis. a separate question asked patients to rate overall care provided. Chief resident schedules and evaluation scores by faculty were provided by the Division of Surgery Education. Regression, and ANOVA models were run using JMP 6 software (JMP 6, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). RESULTS: During this period, 49,081 patients were discharged, 24,540 surveys were mailed, and 5828 surveys were returned (24% response rate). In a simple regression analysis, the predictor variables for nursing, housestaff, and faculty accounted for 57%, 33%, and 28%, respectively, of the variation of overall rating of care delivered (p < 0.005). The actual overall score for each group varied slightly: faculty (89.8), nursing (86.6), and housestaff (84.2) (p < 0.005). In a multiple regression analysis, all predictors above were significant (p < 0.05). A small difference in scores existed between surgical (83.9) and nonsurgical (85.0) housestaff (p < 0.05). When data were sorted by surgical services, ratings of surgical housestaff ranged from a high of 86.8 (thoracic) to a low of 79.0 (orthopedics) (p < 0.05). Admission month had no significant effect on overall rating of care (range, 85-90), although comparing the means of resident scores by month (range, 81-86) showed that at the end (May-June) and at the beginning (July-Aug) of an academic year, a significant reduction in resident scores occurred (p < 0.05). The lowest score of the year (82.4) occurred in June, whereas the highest scores occurred in January-April (85-86). Resident evaluation scores by faculty and ratings of housestaff by patients were completely uncorrelated, although certain housestaff achieved significantly higher ratings by patients than others. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with faculty and residents, nurses have a greater impact on the variation of patient satisfaction. However, the actual scores given to residents, faculty, and nurses are all high. A slight difference exists in scores of surgical and nonsurgical residents. For all residents, the time of the academic year impacts resident scores positively in the middle and negatively in the beginning and end. For surgical residents clear differences exist between specialty services, but it is not apparent whether these differences are caused by individual residents or by the clinical service milieu. Residents contribute significantly to overall satisfaction, and additional investigation of the variation in resident scores is needed.","Resnick, Andrew S     Disbot, Maureen     Wurster, Angela     Mullen, James L     Kaiser, Larry R     Morris, Jon B     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2008 May-Jun;65(3):243-52. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2008.01.005.

"",360 degree feedback: A novel format for a program evaluation committee in an academic emergency medicine residency program,2016,1,1,Western Journal of Emergency Medicine,1936-900X,17,,S38-S39,"Caretta-Weyer, H. and Wilbanks, M. and Snow, B. and Kraut, A. and Barclay-Buchanan, C. and Westergaard, M.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L620927677,English,,,"Background: The ACGME mandates that residency programs maintain a program evaluation committee (PEC) which evaluates the educational activities of the program annually from the vantage point of resident and faculty stakeholders. While the traditional PEC structure does not include input from administrative, nursing, or ancillary staff, these individuals often have useful feedback. We sought to enrich our program evaluation process by eliciting 360 degree reviews of educational experiences from emergency medicine residents, off-service residents and faculty, nursing staff, administrators, and other relevant stakeholders in monthly, rotation-specific reviews. To our knowledge, this represents a novel approach to the PEC and provides the opportunity to explore untapped resources for improving educational experiences. Educational Objectives: 1. Initiate comprehensive, systematic evaluation of program educational experiences in line with function of PEC 2. Collect feedback from key stakeholders, including non-traditional sources, in order to identify actionable, high-yield recommendations for improvement 3. Establish longitudinal tracking of key recommendations to ensure implementation of meaningful change Curricular Design: We implemented a comprehensive multi-source review system in order to expand and accelerate our program evaluation process. Each month, five reviewers (chief resident, resident, program leader, core faculty, administrator) review a documentation packet and conduct interviews of key stakeholders (including non-traditional sources) using reviewer-specific interview tools. The findings are presented for residency-wide discussion at monthly meetings and then integrated into a final document highlighting strengths, areas of concern, and proposed improvements. This document is shared with the rotation director for feedback before negotiating final recommendations, which are tracked for successful implementation on a quarterly basis by the PEC. Impact/Effectiveness: The 360 degree review process uncovers significant opportunities for improvement that are missed by traditional reviews. The negotiation process and formalized recommendations improve accountability on the part of rotation directors. Lastly, residents demonstrate improved understanding and engagement in program evaluation and improvement processes.","L620927677     2018-03-06 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome"
"",Utilizing pediatric chief residents in patient flow management: A systems-based practice,2016,1,1,Academic Pediatrics,1876-2859,16,6,e25-e26,"Adebanjo, T. and Villafranco, N. and Hannemann, N. and Lehecka, K. and Lyn, M. and Hsu, D.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L619743842,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Waits, delays, and cancellations occur frequently in healthcare. Pediatric residents are sometimes unaware of how their daily work habits impact patient flow. Chief residents are leaders with detailed knowledge of inpatient structure and resident daily work flow. Spurred by a need for cultural change to improve patient flow metrics, our hospital administration created a new role, the Patient Flow Chief (Flow Chief), for pediatric chief residents. OBJECTIVES: Describe the creation of an innovative role for pediatric chief residents in patient flow management and assess the Flow Chief's effect on resident behaviors that influence patient flow. METHODS: Setting: Urban quaternary care children's hospital. In our new role, we conducted a needs assessment through discussions with hospital administrators and survey distribution to all pediatric residents to gauge their views on census alerts, discharge barriers, and medical milestones. Six months post-implementation, we re-surveyed all residents to assess for behavior changes. RESULTS: Our needs assessment identified gaps in addressing discharge barriers, identifying safety issues, resident education on patient flow concepts, and working relationships between residency representatives and hospital administrators. Based on these findings, the Flow Chief role consists of 1) participating in administrative meetings 2) developing targeted resident education 3) troubleshooting physician-related discharge barriers 4) participating in quality improvement initiatives. Response rates for pre- and post-implementation resident surveys were 66% & 55% respectively. 47% pre- vs 60% post-implementation respondents indicated expediting discharges when the hospital was on census alert. 49% vs 61% indicated communicating patient discharge barriers with nursing. 72% vs 84% indicated knowing their patient's medical milestones. CONCLUSION: Pediatric chief residents can serve an important role to drive cultural change in patient flow management. Study of the Flow Chief's impact on patient flow and safety at our hospital is ongoing.","L619743842     2017-12-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>true}"

S.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate nontechnical skills in a simulated trauma setting both before and after a debriefing session in order to better understand areas to target for the development of educational interventions. DESIGN: Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare scores on the 5 domains of the T-NOTECHS pre- and postdebriefings. A qualitative analysis using the PEARLS debriefing framework was performed to provide a rich description of the strategies used by the debriefing facilitators. SETTING: The Joint Trauma Simulation Program is an interdisciplinary project designed to improve the quality of trauma care through simulation exercises emphasizing nontechnical skills development. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen teams of 5 trauma trainees participated in trauma resuscitation simulations: a surgical chief resident, a surgical junior resident, an emergency medicine resident, and 2 emergency medicine nurses. RESULTS: Teams significantly improved on communication and interaction skills in the simulation scenarios from pre- to postdebriefing. The debrief facilitators spent most of their time engaged in Directive Performance Feedback (56.13%). CONCLUSIONS: Interprofessional team simulation in trauma resuscitation scenarios followed by debriefing differently affected individual nontechnical skills domains. Additional facilitation strategies, such as focused facilitation and encouraging learner self-assessment, may target other nontechnical skills in different ways.","1878-7452     Sullivan, Sarah     Campbell, Krystle     Ross, Joshua C     Thompson, Ryan     Underwood, Alyson     LeGare, Anne     Osman, Ingie     Agarwal, Suresh K     Jung, Hee Soo     UL1 TR000427/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2018 Jul - Aug;75(4):978-983. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.10.007.

C., 3rd",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical educators strive to identify the best applicants, yet formal study of resident selection has proved difficult. We conducted a systematic review to answer the following question: What objective and subjective preresidency factors predict resident success? METHODS: PubMed, ProQuest, Embase, and the CINAHL databases were queried from 1952 to 2015 for literature reporting the impact of preresidency factors (PRFs) on outcomes of residency success (RS), among neurosurgery and all surgical subspecialties. Due to heterogeneity of specialties and outcomes, a qualitative summary and heat map of significant findings were constructed. RESULTS: From 1489 studies, 21 articles met inclusion criteria, which evaluated 1276 resident applicants across five surgical subspecialties. No neurosurgical studies met the inclusion criteria. Common objective PRFs included standardized testing (76%), medical school performance (48%), and Alpha Omega Alpha (43%). Common subjective PRFs included aggregate rank scores (57%), letters of recommendation (38%), research (33%), interviews (19%), and athletic or musical talent (19%). Outcomes of RS included faculty evaluations, in-training/board exams, chief resident status, and research productivity. Among objective factors, standardized test scores correlated well with in-training/board examinations but poorly correlated with faculty evaluations. Among subjective factors, aggregate rank scores, letters of recommendation, and athletic or musical talent demonstrated moderate correlation with faculty evaluations. CONCLUSION: Standardized testing most strongly correlated with future examination performance but correlated poorly with faculty evaluations. Moderate predictors of faculty evaluations were aggregate rank scores, letters of recommendation, and athletic or musical talent. The ability to predict success of neurosurgical residents using an evidence-based approach is limited, and few factors have correlated with future resident performance. Given the importance of recruitment to the greater field of neurosurgery, these data provide support for a national, prospective effort to improve the study of neurosurgery resident selection.","1878-8769     Zuckerman, Scott L     Kelly, Patrick D     Dewan, Michael C     Morone, Peter J     Yengo-Kahn, Aaron M     Magarik, Jordan A     Baticulon, Ronnie E     Zusman, Edie E     Solomon, Gary S     Wellons, John C 3rd     Journal Article     Review     United States     World Neurosurg. 2018 Feb;110:475-484.e10. doi: 10.1016/j.wneu.2017.11.078.

Both series critically appraise open-access educational blogs and podcasts in EM using an objective scoring instrument. This installment of the blog and podcast watch series curated and scored relevant posts in the specific topic of toxicology emergencies from the AIR-Pro Series. METHODS: The AIR-Pro Series is a continuously building curriculum covering a new subject area every two months. For each area, eight EM chief residents identify 3-5 advanced clinical questions. Using FOAMsearch.net and FOAMSearcher to search blogs and podcasts, relevant posts are scored by eight reviewers from the AIR-Pro editorial board, which is comprised of EM faculty and chief residents at various institutions across North America. The scoring instrument contains five measurement outcomes based on seven-point Likert scales: recency, accuracy, educational utility, evidence based, and references. The AIR-Pro label is awarded to posts with a score of >/=28 (out of 35) points. An ""honorable mention"" label is awarded if board members collectively felt that the blogs were valuable and the scores were > 25. RESULTS: A total of 31 blog posts and podcasts were included. Key educational pearls from the six high-quality AIR-Pro posts and four honorable mentions are summarized. CONCLUSION: The WestJEM ALiEM Blog and Podcast Watch series is based on the AIR and AIR-Pro Series, which attempts to identify high-quality educational content on open-access blogs and podcasts.

V. and Wali, S.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed18&NEWS=N&AN=615581285,,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Burnout rate has reached epidemic levels among medical residents in the newest studies presented at the 2015 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting. Results revealed that internal medicine residents have in fact one of the highest burnout rate (79%). While multifaceted strategy and interventions have been proposed to address burnout for medical residents, current data on interventions for physician burnout are insufficient to recommend particular measures, as more studies are needed to examine the applicability and utility of these interventions in resident physicians. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In a collective effort to promote workplace wellness and prevent resident burnout in a County hospital setting, management team including Chief Residents and Department Chair from an internal medicine residency program teamed up to take action to improve the workplace environment via a strategic implementation of a twice weekly, free therapeutic massage service. DESCRIPTION: Successful implementation of the massage service included three key stages. First, a needs-assessment on resident burnout was conducted that led to the eventual buy-in from key stakeholders including administrative approval to implement the therapeutic massage service. Second, local massage teaching institution was contacted to establish strategic collaboration to allow consistent massage training and in return free massage service provided for residents. Finally, operation of massage service was provided in easily assessable location at the resident lounge, service capacity was limited to 20 min interval for total of 3 hours daily, and service scheduling streamlined via Doodle, a free online scheduling tool. A total implementation cost of $150 was spent on the purchase of a dedicated massage chair. EVALUATION: Utilization data from Doodle and quality data from focus group survey was obtained for analysis. Of the total 168 massage sessions in the first 12 weeks since launching, massage service was utilized at 80 to 100% daily capacity. Approximately 90% of all 75 residents in the residency program have utilized the massage service at least once, and up to 40% of all residents has utilized the service at least twice. Preliminary focus group analysis revealed that residents enjoy the wellness atmosphere created by the massage service in the workplace setting, that the notion of having an onsite massage service reminds residents to make time during work hour to be mindful of their stress level, and that themassage service not only provided a restfulmental break, but also a physical rejuvenation for residents.

DESIGN: Surgical residents care for patients in the clinic and hospital and participate in a communication curriculum. We measure patient perception of resident communication using the Communication Assessment Tool (CAT). We assess resident skills confidence and collect curriculum feedback after each quarterly session. SETTING: 900-bed tertiary care hospital with surgical residency program and simulation center. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents (PGY 1-5). RESULTS: We collected 353 CAT forms from patients in the clinic and hospital on 27 residents. Overall percent ""excellent"" scores (primary outcome) was 84%. In multivariate analysis we found a statistically significant increase in individuals' CAT scores over time at a rate of 1% improvement per month (p = 0.02). We observed significant improvement of skill confidence in 9 out of 10 training modules. Resident perception of the curriculum has improved over time with 90% of learners rating the course ""A"" or ""A+"" across all years.

C. and Dumon, K. R. and Soegaard Ballester, J. M. and Brooks, A. D. and Morris, J. B. and Dempsey, D. T.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: The ability to use electronic medical records (EMR) is an essential skill for surgical residents. However, frustration and anxiety surrounding EMR tasks may detract from clinical performance. We created a series of brief, 1-3 minutes ""how to"" videos demonstrating 7 key perioperative EMR tasks: booking OR cases, placing preprocedure orders, ordering negative-pressure wound dressing supplies, updating day-of-surgery history and physical notes, writing brief operative notes, discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit, and checking vital signs. Additionally, we used ""Cutting Insights""-a locally developed responsive mobile application for surgical trainee education-as a platform for providing interns with easy access to these videos. We hypothesized that exposure to these videos would lead to increased resident efficiency and confidence in performing essential perioperative tasks, ultimately leading to improved clinical performance. METHODS: Eleven surgery interns participated in this initiative. Before watching the ""how to"" videos, each intern was timed performing the aforementioned 7 key perioperative EMR tasks. They also underwent a simulated perioperative emergency requiring the performance of 3 of these EMR tasks in conjunction with 5 other required interventions (including notifying the chief resident, the anesthesia team, and the OR coordinator; and ordering fluid boluses, appropriate laboratories, and blood products). These simulations were scored on a scale from 0 to 8. The interns were then directed to watch the videos. Two days later, their times for performing the 7 tasks and their scores for a similar perioperative emergency simulation were once again recorded. Before and after watching the videos, participants were surveyed to assess their confidence in performing each EMR task using a 5-point Likert scale. We also elicited their opinions of the videos and web-based mobile application using a 5-point scale. Statistical analyses to assess for statistical significance (p </= 0.05) were conducted using paired t-test for parametric variables and a Wilcoxon matched-pair test for nonparametric variables. SETTING: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA (a quaternary teaching hospital within the University of Pennsylvania Health System). PARTICIPANTS: Eleven out of 15 interns (12 entered and 11 completed the study) from our categorical and preliminary general surgery residency programs during the 2016 academic year. RESULTS: Before exposure to the brief ""how to"" videos, 6 of 11 interns were unable to complete all 7 EMR tasks; after exposure, all 11 interns were able to complete all 7 EMR tasks. Moreover, interns' times for each task improved following exposure. Interns self-reported improved confidence in booking an OR case (4 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.6, p = 0.05), ordering negative-pressure wound therapy supplies (3.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.7, p < 0.05), writing a brief operative note (3.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.7, p = 0.05), discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit (3.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.8, p < 0.05), checking vital signs (2.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.8, p </= 0.01), and performing necessary EMR tasks during an emergency situation (2.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.7, p </= 0.0001). Participants also demonstrated a significant improvement in average clinical score on the emergency simulations (5.2 +/- 1.7 vs. 6.6 +/- 0.9, p < 0.05). Interns' opinions of the videos and the mobile phone application were favorable. CONCLUSIONS: In our group of 11 surgery interns, exposure to a series of short ""how to"" videos led to increased confidence and shortened times in performing 7 essential EMR tasks. Additionally, during a simulated perioperative emergency, EMR tasks were performed significantly faster. Clinical performance also improved significantly following exposure to the videos. This just-in-time educational intervention could improve workflow efficiency and clinical performance, both of which may ultimately enhance perioperative patient safety.","1878-7452     Zoghbi, Veronica     Caskey, Robert C     Dumon, Kristoffel R     Soegaard Ballester, Jacqueline M     Brooks, Ari D     Morris, Jon B     Dempsey, Daniel T     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2018 Mar - Apr;75(2):489-496. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.07.009.

Critical Incident Stress Management recommends providing support within 24 to 72 hours. Children's Mercy Kansas City (CMKC) Residency Program did not have a formal system for resident support after events at high risk for ST. OBJECTIVE: To contact at least 75% of residents within 72 hours of involvement in a high risk ST event by March 2015. SETTING: CMKC is a 301 bed hospital with 101 pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents. INTERVENTION: High risk events were identified via multiple avenues of communication including daily safety briefings, email listservs, and open lines of communication with residents. A multidisciplinary team including palliative care, chaplaincy, social work, physician well-being, and chief residents was created to respond to these events. Classification of high risk events was adapted from prior studies. PRIMARY MEASUREMENT: Time from high risk event to resident contact (hours). PDSACYCLES: PDSACycle 1 created a structured process and focused on data collection. Cycle 2 was a temporary project halt during review by the Legal Department (an unexpected but necessary step for project advancement). Cycle 3 had a more refined process and data collection tool based upon Cycles 1 & 2. Cycle 4 added a new notification system. ANALYSIS: Cycle 2 was not included in data analysis due to temporary project suspension. Data was plotted on a run chart. Average time from event to contact for Cycles 1, 3, & 4 was 44.3, 65.0, and 42.2 hours. Combined average time from event to contact was 47.2 hours. Combined, residents were contacted in less than 72 hours 82.9% of the time. LIMITATIONS: Gaps may exist in the system resulting in undernotification of events. CONCLUSION: We were able to create a structured process providing timely contact to residents involved in events at high risk for secondary trauma. NEXT STEPS: Streamline event notification and contact processes and assess its impact on resident well-being.","

R.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Preparation of learners for surgical operations varies by institution, surgeon staff, and the trainees themselves. Often the operative environment is overwhelming for surgical trainees and the educational experience is substandard due to inadequate preparation. We sought to develop a simple, quick, and interactive tool that might assess each individual trainee's knowledge baseline before participating in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). DESIGN: A 4-minute video with 5 separate muted clips from laparoscopic procedures (splenectomy, gastric band removal, cholecystectomy, adrenalectomy, and inguinal hernia repair) was created and shown to medical students (MS), general surgery residents, and staff surgeons. Participants were asked to watch the video and commentate (provide facts) on the operation, body region, instruments, anatomy, pathology, and surgical technique. Comments were scored using a 100-point grading scale (100 facts agreed upon by 8 surgical staff and trainees) with points deducted for incorrect answers. All participants were video recorded. Performance was scored by 2 separate raters. SETTING: An academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: MS = 10, interns (n = 8), postgraduate year 2 residents (PGY)2s (n = 11), PGY3s (n = 10), PGY4s (n = 9), PGY5s (n = 7), and general surgery staff surgeons (n = 5). RESULTS: Scores ranged from -5 to 76 total facts offered during the 4-minute video examination. MS scored the lowest (mean, range; 5, -5 to 8); interns were better (17, 4-29), followed by PGY2s (31, 21-34), PGY3s (33, 10-44), PGY4s (44, 19-47), PGY5s (48, 28-49), and staff (48, 17-76), p < 0.001. Rater concordance was 0.98-measured using a concordance correlation coefficient (95% CI: 0.96-0.99). Only 2 of 8 interns acknowledged the critical view during the laparoscopic cholecystectomy video clip vs 10 of 11 PGY2 residents (p < 0.003). Of 8 interns, 7 misperceived the spleen as the liver in the splenectomy clip vs 2 of 7 chief residents (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Not surprisingly, more experienced surgeons were able to relay a larger number of laparoscopic facts during a 4-minute video clip of 5 MIS operations than inexperienced trainees. However, even tenured staff surgeons relayed very few facts on procedures they were unfamiliar with. The potential differentiating capabilities of such a quick and inexpensive effort has pushed us to generate better online learning tools (operative modules) and hands-on simulation resources for our learners. We aim to repeat this and other studies to see if our learners are better prepared for video assessment and ultimately, MIS operations.","1878-7452     Abdelsattar, Jad M     Pandian, T K     Finnesgard, Eric J     El Khatib, Moustafa M     Rowse, Phillip G     Buckarma, EeeL N H     Gas, Becca L     Heller, Stephanie F     Farley, David R     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2015 Nov-Dec;72(6):e145-50. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.07.012.

Our study utilized logic model for program evaluation to assess the efficacy of a weekly resident study group in improving understanding of clinical site management, preparation for the radiation oncology program exam, and confidence in clinical management skills. The logic model was also used to assess the program organization and efficiency. Material and Methods The resident study group was assessed using the logic model for program evaluation. A study schedule was developed by the chief resident to allow for coverage of all major clinical sites prior to the December in-house exam. Twelve weekly, hour-long sessions were planned from July 31 to December 15, 2017. Data extraction and analysis occurred after six sessions. An anonymized survey using the Jotform platform was generated, with questions based on literature review results of logicmodel based theories of evaluation. Survey questions pertained to program activities, resources used, shortterm outcomes, and early stages of long-term outcomes. Residents could indicate on each survey element whether they found it to be excellent, very good, fair, poor or very poor. Results The study group overall was found to be excellent by half of the residents. The content was described as very good by 67% of the residents. Half of the residents felt the study sessions improving their confidence towards the inhouse exam. The majority of residents felt the organization of the course was excellent (50%) and very good (33%). Use of landmark papers was mostly fair (33%). Adherence to the study schedule was mostly good (50%). The amount of clinical radiation oncology learned was described as very good to good by 66%. A weekly schedule was described as excellent to very good by 50% of the radiation oncology residents. Meeting time at 8 am was described to be excellent to very good by 34% of the residents. Efficient utilization of time was agreed to by 84% of the participants. Half of the residents studied 2-4 hours per week while 17% studied 0-2 hours per week. Preparation for the study group sessions was 0-2 hours and 2-4 hours for 67% and 17% of the residents respectively. Conclusion The radiation oncology resident study group is effective in working towards the goals of the program. About half of the participants felt the course improved their confidence in preparing for the December in-house exam. The majority of participants felt the organization of the program to be excellent to very good. Most of the residents studied 2-4 hours per week for clinical radiation oncology, with about 0-2 hours dedicated to preparing for the resident study group. Therefore, a significant portion of study efforts revolved around study group material. However, there are areas for program improvement, such as utilization of landmark papers.","L623343214     2018-08-08 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"

Objective To educate trainees about the importance of lifelong performance improvement, chief residents at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medicine are members of a multidisciplinary QI team tasked with improving surgical outcomes. We describe the process and the results of this effort. Methods Our analysis used 2 data sources to assess complication rates: the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and ECOMP, our own internal complication database. Chief residents met with a multidisciplinary QI team to review complication rates from both data sources. Chief residents performed a case-by-case analysis of complications and a literature search in areas requiring improvement. Based on this information, chief residents met with the multidisciplinary team to select interventions for implementation, and delivered QI-focused grand rounds summarizing the QI process and new interventions. Results Since 2009, chief residents have presented 16 QI-focused grand rounds. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs) were the most frequently discussed. Interventions to improve UTIs and SSIs were introduced to the department of surgery through these reports in 2011 and 2012. During this time we saw improvement in outcomes as measured by NSQIP odds ratio. Conclusions Departmental grand rounds are a suitable forum to review NSQIP data and our internal, resident-collected data as a means to engage chief residents in QI improvement, and can serve as a model for other institutions to engage surgery residents in QI projects.","1949-8357     Abelson, Jonathan S     Mitchell, Katrina B     Afaneh, Cheguevera     Rich, Barrie S     Frey, Theresa J     Gellman, Carol     Pomp, Alfons     Michelassi, Fabrizio     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2016 May;8(2):232-6. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-15-00179.1.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) program in addiction medicine and to evaluate its impact on chief resident (CR) physicians' substance use knowledge, skills, clinical practice, and teaching. DESIGN: A controlled educational study of CRIT programs (2003, 2004, and 2005) for incoming CRs in generalist disciplines. Intervention CRs were trained to diagnose, manage, and teach about SU. The control CRs sought but did not receive the intervention. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six CR applicants to the CRIT program. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline and 6-month questionnaires assessing substance use knowledge, skills, clinical practice, and teaching. Outcomes were compared within groups from baseline to follow-up and between groups at follow-up. RESULTS: The intervention (n = 64) and control (n = 22) CRs were similar demographically. At 6-month follow-up, the intervention CRs reported a significant increase in SU knowledge, confidence, and preparedness to diagnose, manage, and teach and an increase in SU clinical and teaching practices compared to their baseline and control CRs. CONCLUSIONS: This intensive training for chief residents (CRs) improved knowledge, confidence, and preparedness to diagnose, manage, and teach about substance use (SU), affecting both the CRs' SU clinical and teaching practices. The CRIT program was an effective model for dissemination of SU knowledge and skills to educators in a key position to share this training with a broader audience of medical trainees. This model holds potential to address other high priority medical, yet under-addressed, content areas as well.","1525-1497     Alford, Daniel P     Bridden, Carly     Jackson, Angela H     Saitz, Richard     Amodeo, Maryann     Barnes, Henrietta N     Samet, Jeffrey H     K24 AA015674/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States     R25 DA013582/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     K24-AA015674/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States     R25 DA13582/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     Comparative Study     Journal Article     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     United States     J Gen Intern Med. 2009 Jan;24(1):40-7. doi: 10.1007/s11606-008-0819-2.

H.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Generalist physicians should play a vital role in identifying and managing individuals with substance use but are inadequately trained to do so. METHODS: This 5-year (2008-2012) controlled educational study assessed whether internal medicine and family medicine chief residents' (CRs) addiction medicine teaching increased by co-training with faculty mentors at a Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) program in addiction medicine. All CRIT CR attendees identified a residency program faculty mentor to support addiction medicine teaching after CRIT through functional mentoring with a focus on developing and implementing an Addiction Medicine Teaching Project (""Teaching Project""). Approximately half of the CRs attended CRIT with their mentor (co-trained) and half without their mentor (solo-trained). Addiction medicine teaching outcomes were compared between groups using 6- and 11-month questionnaires and 4 bimonthly teaching logs. Of co-trained CRs, mentor characteristics that positively influenced addiction medicine teaching outcomes were identified. RESULTS: One hundred CRs from 74 residency programs attended CRIT from 2008 to 2012; 47 co-trained with their mentors and 53 solo-trained without their mentors. At 6-month follow-up, the co-trained CRs were more likely to meet at least monthly with their mentor (22.7% vs. 9.6%, P < .01) and more likely to identify their mentor as a facilitator for Teaching Project implementation (82.2% vs. 38.5%, P < .01). At 11-month follow-up, a higher percentage of co-trained CRs had completed their Teaching Project (34.0% vs. 15.1%, P < .05). Both CR groups had similarly large increases in other addiction medicine teaching outcomes. Mentors with more experience, including years of teaching, was associated with better CR Teaching Project outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Co-training generalist chief residents with a faculty mentor appeared to facilitate functional mentoring-driven Teaching Project implementation but did not further increase already high levels of other addiction medicine teaching. Faculty mentors with more years of teaching experience were more effective in facilitating Teaching Project implementation.","1547-0164     Alford, Daniel P     Carney, Brittany L     Jackson, Angela H     Brett, Belle     Bridden, Carly     Winter, Michael     Samet, Jeffrey H     R25 DA013582/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     United States     Subst Abus. 2018 Feb 16:1-7. doi: 10.1080/08897077.2018.1439799.

J. and James, S.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Many organizations make efforts to identify future pediatric leaders, often focusing on chief residents (CRs). Identifying future leaders is an issue of great importance not only to the ultimate success of the organization but also to the profession. Because little is known regarding whether completing a CR predicts future leadership in medicine, we sought to determine if former pediatric CRs when compared with pediatric residents who were not CRs reported more often that they were leaders in their profession. DESIGN/METHODS: Twenty-four pediatric training programs stratified by resident size (<18, 18-36, and >36) and geography (East, South, Midwest, and West) were selected randomly from the Graduate Medical Education Directory (American Medical Association, Chicago, IL). Program directors were contacted by mail and telephone and asked to provide their housestaff rosters from 1965-1985. The resulting resident sample was surveyed by questionnaire in 1995. RESULTS: Fifteen of 17 program directors (88%) who possessed the requested data provided 1965-1985 rosters yielding a sample of 963 residents. Fifty-five percent of the resident sample (533) responded. Fifty-eight of the respondents had not completed a pediatric residency, leaving a survey sample of 475. Thirty-four percent (163) were CRs. The sample had a mean age of 47, 67% were male and 87% married. Fellowships were completed by 51%. More former CRs compared with non-CRs (75% vs 64%), more former fellows than non-fellows (75% vs 60%) and more males than females (74% vs 55%) reported they were professional leaders. These associations persisted in a logistic regression that controlled for CR status, gender, marital status, and fellowship status as leadership predictors. Former CRs, former fellows, and men were, respectively, 1.8, 2.3, and 2.3 times more likely to report professional leadership. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric residents who were former CRs and/or fellows, and males were more likely to report professional leadership. Although men were more likely to report professional leadership, with more women entering pediatrics the reported gender differences will likely disappear over time.","Alpert, J J     Levenson, S M     Osman, C J     James, S     Journal Article     United States     Pediatrics. 2000 Apr;105(4 Pt 2):984-8.

A. and Hatamabadi, H. and Kabir, A.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: Timely diagnosis and treatment of post-traumatic elevated intracranial pressure (EICP) could be reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved patients' outcome. This study is trying to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in detection of EICP. METHODS: Sonographic ONSD of patients with head trauma or cerebrovascular accident suspicious for EICP were evaluated by a trained chief resident of emergency medicine, who was blind to the clinical and brain computed tomography scan (BCT) findings of patients. Immediately after ultrasonography, BCT was performed and reported by an expert radiologist without awareness from other results of the patients. Finally, ultrasonographic and BCT findings regarding EICP were compared. To evaluate the ability of sonographic ONSD in predicting the BCT findings and obtain best cut-off level, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of sonographic ONSD in determining of EICP was calculated. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: There were 222 patients (65.3% male), with mean age of 42.2+/-19.5 years (range: 16-90 years). BCT showed signs of EICP, in 28 cases (12.6%). The means of the ONSD in the patients with EICP and normal ICP were 5.5 +/- 0.56 and 3.93 +/- 0.53 mm, respectively (P<0.0001). ROC curve demonstrated that the best cut off was 4.85 mm. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, PLR, and NLR of ONSD for prediction of EICP were 96.4%, 95.3%, 72.2%, 98.9%, 20.6, and 0.04, respectively. CONCLUSION: Sonographic diameter of optic nerve sheath could be considered as an available, accurate, and noninvasive screening tool in determining the elevated intracranial pressure in cases with head trauma or cerebrovascular accident.","Amini, Afshin     Eghtesadi, Razieh     Feizi, Ali Mohammad     Mansouri, Behnam     Kariman, Hamid     Dolatabadi, Ali Arhami     Hatamabadi, Hamidreza     Kabir, Ali     Journal Article     Iran     Emerg (Tehran). 2013 Fall;1(1):15-9.

"",Morning report for millennials: Re-examining a learnerdriven educational conference,2016,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,31,2,S304-S305,"Anderson, T. and Bonifacino, E. and Carter, A. and Webb, C. M. and McNeil, M. and Zimmer, S. M.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L72288530,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Resident report, in which residents present recent clinical cases they have encountered to their peers, faculty and chief residents, has been a cornerstone of internal medicine graduate medical education for many generations. Some training programs have discontinued resident report due to competing curricular demands and a concern that report lacks a formal curriculum to achieve learning objectives. As teaching priorities change, we sought to examine the characteristics of resident report cases and discussion points at a large tertiary academic medical center residency program to better understand the role of resident report in the millennial era. METHODS: At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) there are daily resident reports at three residency training sites: UPMC Presbyterian - the primary residency tertiary care hospital, UPMC Shadyside - a community affiliate hospital, and the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center. Conference are attended by internal medicine residents, chief medical residents and one or two invited faculty members. Patients are chosen by residents from those whom they have seen in the hospital in the preceding 6 months, occasionally with the assistance of a chief resident. For this study, the chief medical residents at UPMC compiled data on resident reports for 5 months, from July through November 2015. They collected patient age, gender, chief complaint, final diagnosis, and primary specialty of the case. Additionally, chief residents evaluated each case after the conference to determine which if any of the following topics were discussed: patient safety, high value care, clinical reasoning, identification of bias, social determinants of health, and utility of the physical exam. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-three morning report cases were recorded across the three educational sites. 43.8 % of patients were female and 40.1 % were over the age of 65. There were a wide variety of chief complaints with the most common being dyspnea (35), musculoskeletal pain (27), altered mental status (26), abdominal pain (19), fever (19), chest pain (16), skin changes (15), and cough (10). Figure 1 shows the primary specialty of final diagnosis for each case. One third of cases were classified as Zebras or very rare diagnoses (101/283), with the remainder being common diagnoses (139) and four cases with no known diagnosis. The majority of case discussions focused on diagnosis of the underlying etiology (155/283 or 54.8 %), 51 focused on disease management and 77 on both diagnostics and management. Chest x-rays were reviewed in 32.1 % of cases, electrocardiograms in 14.8 % and arterial blood gases in 8.9 %. Figure 2 demonstrates the frequency of topic discussion, with the majority of cases including a discussion of physical exam utility and clinical reasoning. CONCLUSIONS: In a single-residency, three-site observational study, we find resident report to be a unique learner-directed conference in which peer-to-peer discussion addresses multiple curricular priorities. Report cases included rare and common diseases from all medical specialties. Discussions covered essential topics such as high value care, patient safety, and clinical reasoning, as well as foundational physical exam and diagnostic test interpretation skills.

Many chief residents graduate with little exposure to airway emergencies, especially surgical airways. Resident confidence levels are high despite minimal experience. This high confidence-low experience dichotomy may reflect novice overconfidence and suggests the need for improved training methods.","1097-0347     Andrews, James D     Nocon, Cheryl C     Small, Stephen M     Pinto, Jayant M     Blair, Elizabeth A     KL2 RR025000/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States     UL1 RR024999/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Head Neck. 2012 Dec;34(12):1720-6. doi: 10.1002/hed.21998.

A. and Best, J.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622329141,English,,,"Needs and Objectives: As length of stay shortens and the electronic medical record reigns supreme, it has been well-studied that trainees are spending increasingly little time at the bedside of their patients. Especially when caring for a socially vulnerable population, this can lead to two subop-timal outcomes: 1) the patient's context, which may underlie or dictate many of their medical problems, is passed over, and 2) medical students and/or residents may be at increased risk of burnout when not able to create these meaningful connections with patients. Our objective was to demonstrate the value of understanding social context and meaningful connection by designing a project completed by MS3s then disseminated to residents, modeled after a popular photography/narrative project disseminated widely on social media called Humans of New York. Setting and Participants: Harborview Medical Center has dual missions of serving as the county's safety net hospital serving a primarily low-income, marginally housed, and/or immigrant population as well as one of the largest clinical sites affiliated with the University of Washington. Participants are third-year medical students rotating on their inpatient Internal Medicine clerkship, and secondarily the resident teams concurrently on Med-icine Wards. Description: During the second week of their clerkship, medical students were given the following instructions related to one patient:-Block out time in your day to sit down with your patient for at least 20-30 minutes.-Let your patient know you'd like to spend some time getting to know them as a person, and talk with them using prompts as needed. (Ex: What has been your greatest struggle in life to date?) They were also instructed to obtain consent for use of photography, then to spend 10 minutes writing up their patients' stories. Once weekly at morning report, the Chief Resident facilitates medical students sharing the patients' medical one-liner, followed by their personal story, with the group of residents and attendings present. Evaluation: Thus far, qualitative feedback from MS3s includes the fol-lowing:- I probably wouldn't have made time if you didn't assign this project-thanks!- It was a really awesome experience actually, I definitely think it should continue in future clerkships. Next steps include gathering qualitative feedback from residents regarding the experience of passively hearing stories. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: The patient stories unearthed by the students are both emotionally raw and clinically relevant; examples include patients disclosing remote histories of child labor, sexual assault, but also love at first site, getting a GED. As such, this pilot project has been well-received thus far, by the patients, by the medical students, and by the residents. While this project may be well suited to all levels of training, medical students are a wonderful place to start, as ideally early instillation of the value of understanding patients as people, as humans, will remain with them throughout training.","L622329141     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"
"",Addressing the proximal cause of hospitalization: Teaching residents to diagnose and treat substance use disorders in the inpatient setting,2018,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,33,2,682-683,"Appa, A. A. and Jackson, S. L. and Chen, T. and Taniguchi, D.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622330148,English,,,"Needs and Objectives: The marked rise of death and disability due to opioid use disorder (OUD) has thrust the medical community's treatment of pain and addiction medicine into the spotlight. Like many others, our academic institution has rapidly grown our resident curriculum related to addiction medicine to meet this need, though the educational focus has been on an outpatient curriculum. Additional focus is needed on the inpatient setting for two reasons: 1) residents spend the majority of training taking care of hospitalized patients, and 2) inpatients with substance use disorders (SUD) represent a unique clinical opportunity to address the root cause of their hospitalization. Our aim is to improve patient care by increasing access to SUD treatment for this vulnerable population by designing a just-in-time teaching session for inpatient interns at Harborview Medical Center. Setting and Participants: Harborview is a cornerstone of the University of Washington's Internal Medicine program with the largest number of rotating residents at any given time (n=20 PGY1s per month), and also is the county's safety net hospital serving a primarily low-income, marginally housed, and/or immigrant population. Description: Intern Report is a once weekly small-group teaching session run by the Chief Resident. A case-based teaching session run on the second day of the rotation was developed with the following learning objec-tives: Demonstrate ability to take a high-yield substance use history that will inform management Recognize alcohol & opioid use disorder based on DSM V criteria Understand role of methadone & buprenorphine in treating opioid withdrawal and OUD Understand role of naltrexone in treating alcohol use disorder Evaluation: Participants are surveyed just prior to the session and then again following completion of their rotation. The assessment includes demographic information, learner attitudes, and confidence related to diagnosing and treating SUD. Selected initial results related to OUD education are reported here: At baseline, fewer than half of interns felt comfortable diagnosing OUD. Prior to the intervention, 44% reported that they offered opioid agonist treatment for withdrawal at least half of the time, which increased to 67% on post-test. The proportion of interns who reported prescribing opioid agonist therapy in the hospital increased from 1/3 to 2/3 between pre-and post-intervention study. Most (89%) agreed that opioid addiction is a treatable illness, though only 44% reported connecting inpatients with OUD to outpatient therapy, which was unchanged after the intervention. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: We found that residents are most comfortable treating the medical sequelae of addiction (endocarditis, cellulitis, etc.), and that addressing SUD as a proximal cause of hospitalization is a frame-shift that is challenging. However, this innovation may provide support for the concept of just-in-time teaching related to an important social determinant of health in an inpatient context.","L622330148     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"

METHODS: The USMLE step 1 and postgraduate year 1 to 4 CREOG in-training examination scores for the graduating chief residents in eight accredited obstetrics and gynecology residency programs were obtained. Performance on USMLE step 1 was correlated with ABOG examination performance and CREOG in-training examination scores. The correlations between USMLE step 1 and CREOG in-training examination scores and ABOG examination performance were analyzed by using the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: USMLE step 1 scores were significantly correlated with CREOG in-training examination scores (p < 0.000). None of the residents who scored >200 on USMLE step 1 and a mean of >200 on the CREOG in-training examinations failed the ABOG written examination.

We found two articles that are relevant to journal clubs in PM&R: one published in 1995 surveying chief residents specifically discussing journal clubs in PM&R, and a paper published in 2004 evaluating the reading habits of PM&R residents. In doing this review, we discovered that chief residents in PM&R rate disseminating information as their most important goal, impacting clinical practice as their second ranked priority, and teaching critical appraisal skills as a distant third. Conclusions: An organized journal club should have clearlystated goals to ensure that it is a more comprehensive and valuable exercise for both residents and faculty. The main goals should be to disseminate information from the current literature, with a focus on evidence-based medicine, and to teach critical appraisal skills to residents.

E. and Hopkins, R. H., Jr.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Combined internal medicine and pediatrics (medicine-pediatrics) residencies were Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited separately from their corresponding categorical residencies in June 2006. OBJECTIVE: We investigated how ACGME accreditation of medicine-pediatrics programs has affected the levels of support (both financial and personnel), the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) match rate, performance on the board examination, and other graduate outcomes. METHODS: From 2009 through 2013 we sent an annual SurveyMonkey online survey to members of the Medicine-Pediatrics Program Directors Association. Questions pertained to program characteristics, program director support, recruitment, ambulatory training, and graduate data. More than 79% of responders completed the entire survey for each year (sample size was 60 program directors). RESULTS: Compared to the time prior to accreditation of the specialty, there was an increase in program directors who are dually trained (89% versus 93%), an increase in program director salary ($134,000 before accreditation versus $185,000 in 2013, P < .05), and an increase in the average full-time equivalent support (0.32 before accreditation versus 0.42 in 2013, P < .05). There was also an increase in programs with associate program directors (35% versus 78%), programs with chief residents (71% versus 91%), and an increase in program budgets controlled by program directors (52% versus 69%). The 2013 NRMP match rates increased compared to those of 2005 (99% versus 49%). Performance on the American Board of Pediatrics examination was comparable to that for pediatrics residents. Since accreditation, a larger number of residents are choosing careers in hospital medicine.

Medication reconciliation is an effective tool to reduce medication errors, yet internal medicine residents rarely receive formal education on the process. OBJECTIVE: We assessed if an educational intervention on quality improvement principles and effective medication reconciliation for internal medicine residents will lead to fewer medication discrepancies and more accurate discharge medication lists. METHODS: From July 2012 to May 2013, internal medicine residents from 3 academic institutions who were rotating at the Washington DC VA Medical Center received twice-monthly interactive educational sessions on medication reconciliation, using both institutional summary metrics and data from their own discharges. Sessions were led by a faculty member or chief resident. Accuracy of discharge instructions for residents in the intervention group was compared to the accuracy of discharge data from June 2012 for a group of residents who did not receive the intervention. We used chi(2) analysis to assess for differences. RESULTS: The number of duplicate medications (23% versus 12%, P = .01); extraneous medications (14% versus 6%, P = .014); medications sorted by disease or indication (25% versus 77%, P < .001); and the number of discrepancies in discharge summaries (34% versus 11%, P < .001) statistically improved.

J. and Capes, T.",,eng,,,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare surgical and postoperative results after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy between the first 2 cases and last 2 cases performed by each senior resident. DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study (Canadian Task Force classification II-B). SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred six women underwent laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Charts were reviewed to determine length of surgery, operative and postoperative complications, and other surgical values. A comparison was made between the first 2 and last 2 cases of 25 chief residents. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the first 2 and last 2 patients of each resident in terms of age, indication for surgery, uterine mass, ethnicity, body mass index, or parity. There was a significant decrease in the mean time of the first 2 cases versus the last 2 cases: 201.4 minutes versus 137.2 minutes (p <.001). There was no significant difference in blood loss, change in hematocrit, length of hospital stay, and surgical or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy is a technically challenging procedure that nevertheless can be learned quickly with rapid improvement in operative time and without undue risk to the patient. Since initially presenting these data in 2003, the senior residents are now getting twice the amount of exposure to this surgery. In addition, these data now include residents who were exposed to this type of surgery as junior residents.

D. and Yialamas, M.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L615581320,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: A survey revealed that a majority (88%, n = 67) of our residents were interested in additional research exposure during residency training. A focus group of program directors, teaching faculty, and chief residents discussed possible ways to increase resident exposure to research. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Housestaff Research Project (HRP) was designed and implemented as part of the internal medicine residency program at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). All of our residents had the opportunity to participate. DESCRIPTION: BWH medicine residents were engaged in a new research initiative, the HRP, in which the entire house staff participated in a yearly research project. Residents submitted clinical research questions by RFA or small group brainstorming sessions. One representative from each group presented the proposal to the entire house staff, and final projects were selected by resident voting. Funding was provided by the Internal Medicine Residency and the Department of Medicine. In addition, a curriculum which reviewed core research topics was integrated into the conference schedule. EVALUATION: Two projects have been chosen to date. Evaluation has included house staff surveys and interviews with the resident project leaders. Ninety-five percent of residents were familiar with the HRP, mostly through noon conference updates on current projects and/or a research-focused noon conference series. Ten percent of residents were directly involved with data collection and the day to day running of the HRPs. The resident project leaders felt that a strength and unique aspect of the HRP, as compared to other research projects, was the collaboration with co-residents. Both projects have been presented as posters at local or national conferences and manuscripts are in preparation. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: The HRP has broadened the exposure of research concepts to all BWH medicine residents. The resident leaders and those directly involved in the HRP projects experienced the most significant benefits from their involvement, including learning new research skills, developing databases for use in future resident projects, and increased camaraderie with co-residents. Residents are mixed as to whether they prefer to find and lead their own project or join group projects. Our main challenge is maximizing the number of participants while maintaining the integrity of the project and the value of the project for each individual resident.","L615581320     2017-04-26 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome"

K.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: To survey chief residents in accredited oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) training programs to assess their satisfaction with their surgical training and analyze their career plans after residency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 19-question anonymous survey was electronically mailed to 212 individuals identified as graduating chief residents in accredited OMS training programs. RESULTS: Ninety-four individuals (44%) completed the survey. Of these 85 were men (90.4%) and 9 were women (9.6%). Average age was 32 years. Forty-seven respondents (50%) completed the 4-year traditional OMS programs, 37 respondents (39.4%) completed the 6-year MD integrated programs, 9 respondents (9.6%) completed the 4-year MD option programs, and 1 listed ""other"" as a program type. Fifty-two individuals (55.3%) planned a full-time private practice career, 5 (5.3%) planned a full-time academic career, 3 (3.2%) planned a military career, 27 (28.7%) planned a combined private practice and academic career, and 7 (7.4%) planned to complete a fellowship after residency. Seventy-nine of all respondents (84%) were satisfied with their OMS training program, whereas 15 (16%) were not. CONCLUSION: Most participants of this survey were satisfied with their training program and OMS as a career. However, it is important to note that less than half (44%) of chief residents who received this survey completed it. This short survey is a pilot survey; a more involved evaluation of OMS resident satisfaction is planned, further assessing satisfaction and burnout during residency.","1531-5053     Aziz, Shahid R     Ziccardi, Vincent B     Chuang, Sung-Kiang     Journal Article     United States     J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2013 May;71(5):974-80. doi: 10.1016/j.joms.2011.12.004.

G. and Aprikian, A. G. and Kassouf, W.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: We assess outgoing Canadian urology chief residents' well-being, their satisfaction with their surgical training, and their proficiency in surgical procedures throughout their residency program. METHODS: In 2012 an anonymous survey was sent by email to all 29 graduated urology chief residents across Canada. The survey included a list of all urologic surgical procedures listed by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC). According to the A/B/C classification used to assess competence in these procedures (A most competent, C least competent), we asked chief residents to self-classify their competence with regards to each procedure and we compared the final results to the current RCPSC classification. RESULTS: The overall response rate among chief residents surveyed was 97%. An overwhelming majority (96.4%) of residents agreed that the residency program has affected their overall well-being, as well as their relationships with their families and/or partners (67.8%). Overall, 85.7% agreed that research was an integral part of the residency program and 78.6% have enrolled in a fellowship program post-graduation. Respondents believed that they have received the least adequate training in robotic surgery (89.3%), followed by female urology (67.8%), andrology/sexual medicine/infertility (67.8%), and reconstructive urology (61.4%). Interestingly, in several of the 42 surgical procedures classified as category A by the RCPSC, a significant percentage of residents felt that their proficiency was not category A, including repair of urinary fistulae (82.1%), pediatric indirect hernia repair and meatal repair for glanular hypospadias (67.9%), open pyeloplasty (64.3%), anterior pelvic exenteration (61.6%), open varicocelectomy (60.7%) and radical cystoprostatectomy (33.3%). Furthermore, all respondents (100%) believed they were deficient in at least 1 of the 42 category A procedures, while 53.6 % believed they were deficient in at least 10 of the 42 procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Most residents agree that their residency program has affected their overall well-being as well as their relationships with their families and/or partners. There is also a clear deficiency in what outgoing residents perceive they have achieved and what the RCPSC mandates. Future work should concentrate on addressing this discrepancy to assure that training and RCPSC expectations are better aligned.","Bachir, Bassel G     Aprikian, Armen G     Kassouf, Wassim     Journal Article     Canada     Can Urol Assoc J. 2014 Mar;8(3-4):109-15. doi: 10.5489/cuaj.1339.

J.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Residents and physicians frequently find themselves in leadership roles. Current residency curricula focus on the development of clinical knowledge and technical skills. A previous survey of Penn State Dermatology graduates demonstrated the perceived need and benefit of a formalized leadership curriculum in this selected group. OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify and measure the perceived need and benefit of formalized leadership training and investigate opinions regarding leadership theory from the perspective of dermatology residency program directors and chief residents nationally. METHODS: A survey containing 26 questions related to leadership theory and training were mailed to all US dermatology residency programs. RESULTS: In all, 91% of program directors and chief residents agreed that leadership skills could be taught through observation and training. A total of 78% of respondents agreed that leadership training is important during dermatology residency training. In all, 66% agreed that a formalized leadership curriculum would help residents become better resident supervisors and physicians. Only 13% reported having a formalized leadership curriculum. Participants most frequently reported learning leadership through observation and modeled behavior. A total of 15% of chief residents believed their faculty did not effectively model leadership, whereas only 2% of the program directors believed the same (P = .01). LIMITATIONS: In all, 62% (68/109) of programs surveyed returned at least one response from the program director or chief resident. A total of 39% (42/109) had responses from both the program director and the chief resident. Because of the voluntary nature of the survey, response bias could not be excluded. CONCLUSION: Most program directors and chief residents believe leadership skills can be cultivated through observation and training. Leadership curriculum is not part of most residency programs.","1097-6787     Baird, David S     Soldanska, Magdalena     Anderson, Bryan     Miller, Jeffrey J     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Am Acad Dermatol. 2012 Apr;66(4):622-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2009.10.009.

14731096,Pediatric residency training on domestic violence: a national survey,2004,1,1,Ambul Pediatr,1530-1567,4,1,24-7,"Bair-Merritt, M. H. and Giardino, A. P. and Turner, M. and Ganetsky, M. and Christian, C. W.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Between 3.3 and 10 million children witness domestic violence (DV) each year. These children are at risk for both emotional and behavioral problems. In 1998, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines for pediatricians to screen for DV and for residency programs to include DV education. Prior studies have assessed practicing pediatricians' DV screening habits. This study was designed to assess chief residents' attitudes and training regarding DV screening. METHODS: A 53-question survey regarding residents' attitudes and training surrounding DV was mailed to the chief residents of all 194 nonmilitary US pediatric residency programs. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of surveys were returned. Sixty-eight percent of respondents were female. Although 93% of chief residents felt that pediatricians should screen for DV, only 21% screen every patient. Only 24% agreed or strongly agreed that they felt experienced in handling DV cases. Although 60% of respondents say that they received 11 or more hours of residency training in how to handle child abuse, the majority (80%) received 4 hours or less of DV training. Seventy-one percent agreed or strongly agreed that pediatricians do not screen secondary to lack of training. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric chief residents believe that DV is a significant pediatric health problem. However, screening practices are variable. Most chief residents feel that their training was not sufficient to make them comfortable screening for DV. Chief residents demonstrated openness to incorporating DV training into their programs, indicating a positive environment for DV curricula.","Bair-Merritt, Megan H     Giardino, Angelo P     Turner, Marisa     Ganetsky, Michael     Christian, Cindy W     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Ambul Pediatr. 2004 Jan-Feb;4(1):24-7.

METHODS: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education program data from 2008 to 2011 (University of Medicine and Dentistry-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ) were analyzed to identify categories where volume was below national average. This was compared with case logs from 3 missions conducted by International Surgical Health Initiatives between 2011 and 2012. RESULTS: All chief residents completed more than minimum required index cases. Categories head and neck, alimentary tract, abdomen, and endocrine showed percentile below national average. Seven residents participated in 3 missions to Philippines and Sierra Leone. Sixty-five percent of the operations performed were in the 4 low-volume categories. CONCLUSIONS: International surgery missions expose residents to a high volume and variety of cases. Participation can be one way to increase case volume and diversity during training.

Total number of endoscopies performed throughout residency was recorded. Procedures performed as fifth-year residents with indirect supervision were evaluated for quality measures. RESULTS: An average of 76 esophagogastroduodenoscopies and 147 colonoscopies were performed through their first 4 years of residency. Chief residents performed an average of 16 esophagogastroduodenoscopies and 22 colonoscopies. Of colonoscopies performed during their fifth year, 191 were performed while the resident had only indirect supervision. During these cases, cecal intubation was achieved in 90.6% of cases, an average of .48 polyps were identified, and average scope withdrawal time was 13.4 +/- 7.1 minutes.

However, there is wide variability in the level of teaching, and levels of student participation2. Currently, there are few studies with a structured lesson plan. Recently at our institution, a standardized bedside curriculum was implemented using both resident and medical student teaching in the form of daily bedside presentations. The goal of this study was to identify how students felt about this structure and establish the feasibility of this curriculum on a busy general surgery service. Methods: Surveys were provided to students completing a 4 week rotation in general surgery. During the course of their rotation, students performed short bedside presentations on common surgical diseases seen on a typical general surgery clerkship on daily rounds. Additional topics were taught directly by a single chief resident. Following their rotation, students were asked to rate the quality of their instruction, and select which modalities of learning were most helpful. The data was collected using a 5 point Likert scale. Results: A total of 15 medical students participated in this study. Of these, 12 (80%) had completed most or all their core rotations (family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, ob/gyn, pediatrics), and 3 (20%) had completed none. All students felt that preparing and presenting their allocated topics was a very educative exercise. Fourteen students (93%) would like to see this model of structured teaching on other clerkships. All the students acknowledged the dedication and capabilities of the residents as good teachers. They felt the combination of resident teaching and individual case presentations improved their knowledge and interest in the general surgery clerkship. Conclusions: A structured curriculum of bedside teaching utilizing both resident and student prepared presentations on a time constrained residency program involves dedication and planning. However, the majority of students in this study want to see this structure on other rotations. Dedicated teaching of medical students by their peers and surgical residents is challenging but feasible on a busy surgical service. Further research into the influence on OSCE, shelf scores, and effect on career choice as a result of this increased interaction is warranted.","L70973548     2013-01-25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"

P. and Jessop, N. W. and Hendrick, R. E.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent radiology residents are being trained in quality assurance procedures for mammography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted with 189 chief residents and 10 other senior residents from 199 of the 209 residency training programs in diagnostic radiology. RESULTS: Time spent on mammography rotations averaged 8 weeks. Only 10 residents (5%) were ""very familiar"" with the American College of Radiology (ACR) Mammography Accreditation Program; 72 (36%) were ""not at all familiar"" with it. Ninety-six (48%) knew that one technologist should be assigned quality control procedures. The majority did not know the recommended frequency for performing any of the five routine quality control procedures; only one knew the recommended frequencies for all five. Only twenty-seven (14%) knew the recommended maximum dose for a mammogram. Regarding biopsy yields and false-negative results: 92 residents (46%) sat in on outcome evaluation sessions; 54 (27%) played active roles, looking up and tabulating results; and 53 (27%) did not participate at all. CONCLUSION: Although time spent on mammography rotations has increased substantially, quality assurance issues are still largely neglected. It may not be reasonable for radiology residents to have detailed instruction in quality assurance procedures for mammography, but they should be more familiar with the general issues involved and the procedures intended to correct the problem of the variable quality of mammography in this country.","Bassett, L W     Lubisich, J P     Bresch, J P     Jessop, N W     Hendrick, R E     U50/CCU30616701/PHS HHS/United States     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

A.",,ger,,,"Background Stress with negative influence on health (distress) is highly prevalent among surgeons. Especially the physicians' own perception of working conditions plays an important role in an evaluation of the stress potential of working conditions. Thus, this study is intended to examine and evaluate the working conditions of surgeons in German hospitals. Material and Methods This web-based study is methodically based on the theoretical stress models of Siegrist (Effort-Reward-Imbalance Model) and Karasek (Job-Demand-Control Model). The questionnaire designed for this survey consists of items from two validated questionnaires. Thus it is possible to draw a conclusion about the job satisfaction and distress prevalence among surgeons concerning working conditions in German hospitals. Results In this study 58.2% (95% CI: 55.6 - 61.5) of respondents showed unfavourable working conditions (ER/JDC ratio > 1). Meanwhile 52.2% (95% CI: 49.3 - 55.1) were satisfied with their job. The distress prevalence among female surgeons was six percent points higher (95% CI: 0.1 - 12.0) at 62.4% with an odds ratio compared to male surgeons of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.01 - 1.65; p < 0.05). Chief residents, in comparison to functional positions, showed with 22.0% the lowest distress prevalence of all positions. The highest prevalence was shown by fellows with 66.7% (OR: 7.11; 95% CI: 3.26 - 15.48; p < 0.001). Furthermore 43.4% of fellows said that they were very satisfied with their job. Among attendings 61.5% stated this (OR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.52 - 2.84; p < 0.001). Conclusions The outlined data emphasise a high stress-potential among surgeons in hospitals concerning working conditions. According to the ERI/JDC model emphasis should be put on the balance between effort and reward or, respectively, job demands and control.","1438-9592     Bauer, J     Groneberg, D A     English Abstract     Journal Article     Germany     Zentralbl Chir. 2017 Dec;142(6):590-598. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1350893.

"","Not too much, not too little, but just right: Goldilocks rounds at the cambridge health alliance",2014,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,29,,S527,"Bedard, R. E. and Rapoport, A. B. and Batalden, M.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71496001,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: The AGCME identifies Systems-Based Practice (SBP) as a core competency for internal medicine residents; sub-competencies described in this domain include providing cost-effective care, recognizing system errors and advocating for systems improvement. Through the new Clinical Learning Environment Review program, the ACGME expects training institutions to engage residents in efforts to ensure that their delivery system is providing safe, high quality, evidence-based care to patients. With these mandates, training programs across the country seek to build meaningful curricular opportunities for residents in this domain. The Goldilocks Rounds at the Cambridge Health Alliance provides an innovative forum for Internal Medicine residents to discuss cases involving the overuse, underuse and misuse of healthcare resources and to design and implement small tests of change. The objectives of these rounds are as follows: - To provide a forum for honest disclosure and discussion of clinical errors and system failures - To encourage residents to identify examples in their own practice of the overuse or inappropriate use of healthcare resources -To help residents articulate one improvement oriented action item from each rounds that residents have the power to implement in real time SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) is an integrated public healthcare system comprised of two community hospitals and an extensive primary care network. The internal medicine residency has 8 residents in each of the PGY-1, 2 and 3 years; there are an additional 8 psychiatry interns and 7 transitional-year interns who also train on one 32-bed inpatient medicine teaching unit. All residents are invited to monthly Goldilocks Rounds. The two chief medical residents facilitate rounds. Hospitalist teaching faculty are present to offer guidance; an open invitation is extended to nursing staff. DESCRIPTION: Goldilocks Rounds are scheduled during lunch hour at regular intervals throughout the year. Housestaff come to rounds prepared with recent stories from their own practice that exemplify the overuse or misuse of medical resources, situations in which a clinical error was made, or a system failure occurred. An unnecessary blood draw, a misunderstanding with a nurse: Trainees are encouraged not to accept these issues as byproducts of a complex health system but to identify them as areas for improvement and come up with solutions. During Goldilocks Rounds, participants select 1-2 pressing problems raised in the case discussion, brainstorm potential interventions, and commit to taking some individual or group action. Facilitators help formulate discrete, simple, positive interventions that are within the scope of the residents to enact. When applicable, chief residents lead the group in filing a formal occurrence report to model the importance of reporting errors. Residents are the primary physicians on this dedicated inpatient teaching unit; they interact consistently with the same group of nurses and ancillary staff and can exercise genuine leadership in changing the practice environment. Action items that have resulted from Goldilocks Rounds during this academic year include patient education about how to ask for PRN medications in the hospital and improved end of shift signout protocols between day and night resident teams. EVALUATION: Prior to the first Goldilocks Rounds all house officers were invited to complete a survey on their attitudes and perceived self-efficacy regarding SBP and quality improvement. Sixty percent of residents responded. The same survey will be administered at the end of this academic year to assess change in attitudes and selfefficacy in these domains. Residents are informally invited to offer feedback on Goldilocks Rounds to the chief residents throughout the year. Finally, the chief medical residents follow up each rounds with a synopsis of issues discussed and proposed interventions. Chief residents audit the implementation and efficacy of those interventions goin forward, unless a specific resident champion is identified. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Baseline survey results revealed that 43 % of respondents report feeling very comfortable discussing a medical error with a fellow housestaff. Only 21 % are very comfortable filing a formal occurrence report. Only 22 % currently feel very comfortable raising issues about healthcare costs and use of medical resources with their attending physician. Despite this, 72 % of respondents report that they strongly agree with the statement My role as a physician includes a responsibility to improve the system of care in which I practice. Certainly this enthusiasm for systems-improvement work is evident in the Goldilocks Rounds discussions where trainees are eager to volunteer experiences and generate improvement suggestions. The Goldilocks Rounds are a promising strategy for bringing systems-based practice into the residency curriculum in a practical, relevant way that impacts both resident learning and patient care.","L71496001     2014-06-17 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The Moroccan culture, as many Arab cultures do, places a great emphasis on the first-born child; the first son in particular grants great pride and esteem to a family. Although the legal-religious organization of no two Arab countries is identical, women are stereotypically represented as oppressed and subordinate. This perception is reinforced by a patriarchal class system that has dominated the Arab world for thousands of years. Unlike in the West where the individual is the basic unit of the state, it is the family that is the basis of Arab states. Within this framework, the rights of women are expressed solely in their roles as wives and mothers (Handal 2000; Sebbar 2000). It was within this framework that the author was raised. She goes on to say that there remains a strong, unspoken differential in the impressions and expectations of women versus men as leaders. A woman, because of predefined and learned perspectives, will encounter a variety of forces that challenge her desire to be viewed as a competent, valuable, and potent leader. In particular, in the transition out of her training years (from resident, to chief resident, to attending physician), the author has been increasingly mindful of this phenomenon. It remains a struggle for her to find her individual equilibrium, especially in the academic world at Georgetown. She is more and more aware of opinions and critiques about her teaching and leadership style that seem related in many ways to her gender. She goes on to discuss the importance of the balance between personal and professional life, establishing limits and 'learning how to say no.' Feeling overworked, overwhelmed, overstressed and overcommitted leads to an unproductive, fruitless life.

METHODS: During a 2-month period, surgeons in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology were asked to double glove during all operative procedures. At the conclusion of surgery, the gloves were collected and the surgeons noted the type of procedure and their role as primary surgeon or first assistant. They also indicated whether a perforation was recognized intraoperatively. The gloves were tested for damage by first filling them with air and immersing them in water and then by directly filling them with water. RESULTS: Four hundred forty-one sets of double gloves were evaluated. Of these, 61 sets (14%, 95% confidence interval 10.8-17.2%) had holes in at least one of the four gloves and six sets had more than one perforation, for a total of 67 holes. Fifty-two holes (78%) penetrated only the outer glove and nine (13%) were only in the inner glove. Penetration of both gloves at identical sites occurred in only six of the total glove sets (1.4%, 95% confidence interval 0.3-2.5%). The two most common sites of perforation were the thumb and index finger of the nondominant hand. Glove perforation occurred in 15% of cesarean deliveries and 11% of vaginal deliveries, a nonsignificant difference. In contrast, penetration occurred in 28% of major gynecologic procedures (P less than .05 compared with cesarean or vaginal delivery). Chief and third-year residents were significantly more likely to sustain perforation than were attending physicians or junior residents (P less than .01). Perforation to the gloves of chief residents typically occurred while they were serving as assistants for first- and second-year residents. Third-year residents usually sustained perforations while functioning as primary surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Glove perforations occur with relatively high frequency during pelvic surgery, particularly abdominal procedures. Double gloving offers a measure of protection against damage to the inner glove and may prevent subsequent exposure of the surgeon to blood and other body fluids.","Bennett, B     Duff, P     Journal Article     United States     Obstet Gynecol. 1991 Dec;78(6):1019-22.

I. and Dzara, K. and Mazhar, M. N. and Behere, A.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirements stipulate that psychiatry residents need to be educated in the area of emergency psychiatry. Existing research investigating the current state of this training is limited, and no research to date has assessed whether the ACGME Residency Review Committee requirements for psychiatry residency training are followed by psychiatry residency training programs. METHODS: We administered, to chief resident attendees of a national leadership conference, a 24-item paper survey on the types and amount of emergency psychiatry training provided by their psychiatric residency training programs. Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Of 154 surveys distributed, 111 were returned (72% response rate). Nearly one-third of chief resident respondents indicated that more than 50% of their program's emergency psychiatry training was provided during on-call periods. A minority indicated that they were aware of the ACGME program requirements for emergency psychiatry training. While training in emergency psychiatry occurred in many programs through rotations-different from the on-call period-direct supervision was available during on-call training only about one-third of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that about one-third of psychiatry residency training programs do not adhere to the ACGME standards for emergency psychiatry training. Enhanced knowledge of the ACGME requirements may enhance psychiatry residents' understanding on how their programs are fulfilling the need for more emergency psychiatry training. Alternative settings to the on-call period for emergency psychiatry training are more likely to provide for direct supervision.","1949-8357     Bennett, Jeffrey I     Dzara, Kristina     Mazhar, Mir Nadeem     Behere, Aniruddh     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2011 Mar;3(1):21-5. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-10-00056.1.

However, there are many differences between the two systems. Medical training is not organized in the same way. Americans must obtain a University Master's degree before entering medical school and selection by entrance examinations at the end of the first year and at internship is specific to France. In the U.S.A., admission to a urology training programme is based on national matching, in which the candidate's personality and career are at least as important as his or her examination results. Residency lasts for about the same duration as in France. General surgical training is more succinct. Residency ends with a year of Chief Resident, which validates the practical training. A registrar position is not systematic. Residents can complete their training by a specialized fellowship (endourology, oncology, urogynaecology...) when they are planning a university career. Residents receive a very good intellectual education throughout their training, designed to prepare them for the Board certification which validates their training and authorizes them to practice. Finally, the possibility to conduct research in parallel with clinical practice is probably one of the greatest advantages of the American system which benefits from greater resources and a particularly effective organization. French and American training programmes are not organized in the same way for cultural, social and economic reasons. It would no doubt be beneficial to consider the positive aspects of transatlantic training to improve and maintain the excellence of French urology.","Bensalah, Karim     Traxer, Olivier     Shariat, Shahrokh F     Zimmern, Philippe     Comparative Study     English Abstract     Journal Article     France     Prog Urol. 2007 Nov;17(7):1367-71.

METHODS: Eight consecutive residency classes (starting 2001-2008; 4 residents/y) were reviewed. Three hundred and thirty-three applicants (40.6 applicants/y) were interviewed, and 316 (94.9%) were ranked. Residents matching with our program were divided 3 different ways: into quarters, thirds, and halves, based on their rank order. Correlation coefficients were obtained to compare resident rank number and rank group (quarter, third, half) to faculty evaluation, coresident evaluation, and in-service score. Chi-square tests were conducted comparing rank group to chief resident selection and annual teaching award. RESULTS: Resident NRMP rank number was not significantly correlated with faculty evaluation, coresident evaluation, or in-service exam score (-0.21 < r < 0.05; P > .28). There was also no significant correlation between resident quarter, third, or half rank group and faculty evaluation; coresident evaluation; or in-service exam score (-0.29 < r < 0.10; P > .13). Chi-square analysis found no relationship between resident rank group and chief resident (P > .35) or teaching award (P > .13) selection. CONCLUSIONS: Applicant rank number and rank group did not correlate with performance of this otolaryngology residency cohort as assessed by faculty evaluation, coresident evaluation, in-service exam score, or selection for chief resident or the annual teaching award. Resident selection committees should consider reallocating manpower hours from creating rank order to recruiting applicants and selecting interview candidates.","1097-6817     Bent, John P     Colley, Patrick M     Zahtz, Gerald D     Smith, Richard V     Parikh, Sanjay R     Schiff, Bradley     Fried, Marvin P     Journal Article     England     Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2011 Apr;144(4):537-41. doi: 10.1177/0194599810396604.

METHODS: A Web-based survey was distributed electronically to the program directors and chief residents of 188 radiology residency programs. Survey responses were collected for two weeks in November-December 2006. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 91 Program Directors and 165 Chief Residents. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups of respondents on any of the 9 questions pertaining to the proposed call requirement change. Approximately 70% of the program directors and 80% of the chief residents disagreed or disagreed strongly that they were in favor of the proposed ACGME change. Strong opposition to the change was independent of both program size and current compliance with the proposed change. Over 70% in both groups disagree or strongly disagree that the proposed change would positively affect residency training.

The government wants to reform the residency process to homogenize medical studies. However, the suggested residency program changes would imply changes in the length of residency, in the mobility of residents after residency, their access to unconventional sectors, and more generally, the responsibility of the resident and his/her status in the hospital. In this context, we have investigated the future plans of all psychiatry residents in France. GOALS: To study the desires of psychiatry residents in France, regarding their training, their short and long-term career plans, and to analyze the evolution of those desires over the last 40 years. METHODOLOGY: A survey was carried out among residents in psychiatry from November 2011 to January 2012. An anonymous questionnaire including four parts (resident's description, residency training and trainees choice, orientation immediately after residency, professional orientation in 5-10 years) was sent by the French Federative Association of Psychiatrists Trainees (AFFEP) to all French psychiatrist trainees, through their local trainee associations (n=26) and through an on line questionnaire. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 853 of the 1615 psychiatry residents (53%), of which 71% were women. At the end of the residency, 76% of residents reported that they would like to pursue a post-residency position (chief resident, senior physician assistant university hospitals); 22% reported wanting to work in another city. Between 5 to 10 years after completion of the residency, 71% reported wanting to work in a hospital, and 40% preferred to have their own private practice. Almost a third of the trainees wished to work in the child and adolescent psychiatry field, for some of them in an exclusive way, for others, combined with a practice in adult psychiatry.","Berger-Vergiat, A     Chauvelin, L     Van Effenterre, A     English Abstract     Journal Article     Review     France     Encephale. 2015 Feb;41(1):17-24. doi: 10.1016/j.encep.2013.02.006.

The millennial generation's learning preferences also force us to reconsider how to reach physicians in training. Social media is emerging as a viable tool for advancing curricula in graduate medical education. OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to understand how social media enhances a residency program's educational mission. METHODS: While chief residents in the 2013-2014 academic year, two of the authors (PB, AN) maintained a Twitter feed for their academic internal medicine residency program. Participants included the chief residents and categorical internal medicine house staff. RESULTS: At the year's end, the authors surveyed residents about uses and attitudes toward this initiative. Residents generally found the chief residents' tweets informative, and most residents (42/61, 69%) agreed that Twitter enhanced their overall education in residency. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this single-site intervention corroborate that Twitter can strengthen a residency program's educational mission. The program's robust following on Twitter outside of the home program also suggests a need for wider adoption of social media in graduate medical education. Improved use of data analytics and dissemination of these practices to other programs would lend additional insight into social media's role in improving residents' educational experiences.","Bergl, Paul A     ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9406-2792     Narang, Akhil     ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9248-808X     Arora, Vineet M     ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4745-7599     Journal Article     Canada     JMIR Med Educ. 2015 Jul 10;1(2):e5. doi: 10.2196/mededu.4434.

Pearson's chi-squared test was used to evaluate whether statistically significant differences existed between answers provided by the two study populations. Results: The survey was disseminated to 200 individuals in 85 U.S. residency programs as some programs identified more than one CR; 44/ 85 PDs (52%) and 71/115 (62%) CRs responded. There were no significant differences between the two groups of respondents in terms of program size or description (community, tertiary care, university-based).

Both verbal handoff and supplemental document are vulnerable to errors. Objectives Of Program/Intervention (No More Than Three Objectives): It is necessary to develop a handoff system that optimizes the efficient transfer of critical clinical information while minimizing the possibilities of error. The purpose of this work is to describe our experience and the lessons learned in successfully developing a handoff system for resident physicians in our hospital. Description Of Program/Intervention, Including Organizational Context (E.G. Inpatient Vs. Outpatient, Practice Or Community Characteristics): EHR-integrated handoff system known as Physician Worklist was introduced to replace the original handoff tool used on all Internal Medicine inpatient service. Residents led further improvisation in Physician Worklist that created I-PASS an EHR-integrated handoff system. This new system was named Physician Handoff. Residents and Information Technology team came together to identify reasons for not using Physician worklist. Residents also gave constructive feedback and ITcreated new tool following I-PASS. The leadership of Department of Medicine and CMIO also were actively involved and committed. All residents were credentialed by chief residents in the new system. Measures Of Success (Discuss Qualitative And/Or Quantitative Metrics Which Will Be Used To Evaluate Program/Intervention): Anonymous survey was conducted to evaluate satisfaction, adaptation rate, and feedback on EHR integrated system. Trained observers evaluated verbal handoff to measure the quality of information received by the incoming residents in the following categories: Illness Severity, Appropriate Chart Review, Patient Information, Code Status, Primary Diagnosis and Situational Awareness. Findings To Date (It Is Not Sufficient To State Findings Will Be Discussed): Adaptation rate of Physician Worklist among residents was at 8.70%, while adaptation rate for Physician Handoff was 83.34%. Satisfaction rate was high for Physician Handoff (7.1 out of 10) and low for Physician Worklist (1.7 out of 10). 83.33% of the residents believe Physician Handoff is more efficient compared to previously used handoff tools. Over the 622 observed handoffs, near perfect handoffs were observed in all evaluated categories except for Primary Diagnosis (439 out of 622 or 70.58% satisfactory handoffs) and Situational Awareness (521 out of 622 or 83.76% satisfactory handoffs). KEY LESSONSFORDISSEMINATION(WHATCANOTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): An efficient handoff system should be time-saving while ensures accurate and vital patient information is passed onto the receiving residents.

There is evidence suggesting that 46% to 56% of all medication errors occur at transfer points of care. Objectives Of Program/Intervention (No More Than Three Objectives): Medication reconciliation is crucial at transition points to reduce the high incidence of medication errors. At NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, an initiative was taken to standardize the process of medication reconciliation at transfer points using Electronic health record. Description Of Program/Intervention, Including Organizational Context (E.G. Inpatient Vs. Outpatient, Practice Or Community Characteristics): Developing EHR tool was the first step. Cerner EHR is equipped with a 'transfer reconciliation' link that can be accessed at points of transition during a patient's hospital stay. This was very similar to the process which all users are familiar which is the admission and discharge medication reconciliation. Selection of the unit: All patient from critical care units to step down unit were tracked for the medication reconciliation. Later all transfer from the critical care unit were tracked reaching their destination irrespective of the floor or unit. Education and instructions were given to all residents how to perform medication reconciliation. They were also informed that they will be monitored by chief residents for the medication reconciliation on all patients transferred from critical care unit. Measures Of Success (Discuss Qualitative And/Or Quantitative Metrics Which Will Be Used To Evaluate Program/Intervention): The resident's compliance with Cerner EHR was monitored for completeness and accuracy. Appropriate feedback from the chief residents was given to all residents about. The residents were evaluated and educated on their use of Cerner EHR at transfer points of care. The study lasted 21 weeks and electronically tracked on Cerner EHR 102 patients that were downgraded from the ICU to the Pulmonary Step-Down Unit. Findings To Date (It Is Not Sufficient To State Findings Will Be Discussed): All downgrades from the ICU to the Pulmonary Step Down (PSD) were reviewed. From a total of 51 patient charts, 24 were reconciled appropriately in week 1 to 11. The average percentage of compliance was 47%. Upon intervention from the Chief Residents, 49 of the 51charts were reconciled in weeks 12 to 21. Compliance with transfer medication reconciliation increased to 96%. Keylessons Fordissemination(Whatcan Otherstake Away For Implementation To Their Practice Or Community?): Overall, transition points in healthcare are vulnerable times for patients. It is important to organize smooth transitions to ensure proper continuity of care for patients. Prior to this study it was known that NYPBMH implemented medication reconciliation upon patient admission and discharge. What was not known was the level of compliance with medication reconciliation during transfers of care. We presume medication reconciliation happened at the time of the transition.

METHODS: Written questionnaire of 80 physicians at a Swiss public primary and secondary referral center and teaching hospital surveying stressors and resources in the working conditions as well as associated subjective strains. Selective observation of work activities of 14 representative R and CR. RESULTS: Stressors: R and CR reported a deficit in 6 out of 10 expectations regarding their work (greatest deficits: lack of time off, lack of future career prospects and of clear management). The deficits for the R/CR group differed in part highly significantly from deficits reported by directing physicians and medical directors. Work intensity was experienced as high or too high in 72% of R and 67% of CR. Strains: 41% of R and 43% of CR met criteria for emotional exhaustion, and 34% of R and 14% of CR reached critical values for aversion to patients. These strains correlated significantly with the stressors ""overburdened through heavy workload"", ""subjective work intensity"", ""inadequate leisure time"", and ""lack of a right to a say in important matters"" (all p between <0.001 and <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Work-related emotional exhaustion and aversion to patients reached a critical mass in R and CR and was underestimated by both physicians and hospital management. The significant correlations between stressors and strains point to the main areas for improvement: reduction in work intensity and workload, change in style of leadership and management, development of new work models.","Biaggi, P     Peter, S     Ulich, E     Journal Article     Switzerland     Swiss Med Wkly. 2003 Jun 14;133(23-24):339-46. doi: 2003/23/smw-10134.

These duties lay the groundwork that prepares chief residents to assume future leadership positions. INTERVENTION: We propose a new model for multiple chief residents. In this system, there are leadership roles for resident and medical student education, ultrasonography, resident research, and high-fidelity simulation in addition to the traditional administrative roles. This model can be modified to match the needs of a given program and the aptitudes of the senior residents. RESULTS: We describe the successful implementation of this model at our program, which has resulted in a progressive curriculum, increased resident leadership, and program ownership among the residents. CONCLUSIONS: Our intervention offers an alternative model for overcoming some of the limitations of the traditional chief resident model, including some chief residents who become overwhelmed by their duties and are discouraged from pursuing future leadership roles. It also has the potential to offer other senior residents with various skills and leadership abilities the opportunities to contribute to their program.","1949-8357     Biese, Kevin     Leacock, Benjamin W     Osmond, Christopher R     Hobgood, Cherri D     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2011 Jun;3(2):236-8. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-10-00045.1.

METHODS: An electronic questionnaire was sent by email between June 2009 and January 2010 to the 288 French urologists currently in training. Items analysed included demographics, achievement of academic works and post-residency projects. RESULTS: Overall, we obtained 156 answers (response rate of 54%). Our population was composed by 47 (27%) fellows and 114 (73%) residents. They work 68.1 hours per week and 31 (20%) leave the hospital after an on-call night. Thirty-two (20.5%) have validated a master 2. Among the resident, 54 (47.3%) are certain to have the opportunity to be a chief resident. Regarding residents, factors significantly associated with the fact to obtain a fellowship in multivariate analysis were: to gain a master 2, working more than 65 hours per week and achieving academics works. Installation in a general hospital, a university hospital and a private clinic was considered by respectively 21.7%, 41.6% and 67.3% of young urologists.

T.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND : Burnout is a serious concern in graduate medical education. While enhancing resilience in trainees is considered beneficial, there are few studies showing successful interventions. OBJECTIVE : We developed and implemented a curriculum to teach resilience skills to internal medicine (IM) residents. METHODS : Our resilience curriculum focused on 4 small group skill-building workshops: setting realistic goals, managing expectations, letting go after stressful clinical events, and finding gratitude. All sessions were delivered by a chief resident during dedicated teaching time, and combined lectures, group discussions, reflection, and simulated skill-building exercises. Participants were assessed before and after the curriculum using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. RESULTS : Over a period of 2 years, 81 interns participated; 75% (61 of 81) responded prior to participating in the curriculum, and 79% (64 of 81) responded after participation. The majority thought sessions should continue the following year (75%, 48 of 64). Postsession, participants were more comfortable talking about stress and burnout (70%, 44 of 63), were more comfortable talking about medical errors (73%, 46 of 63), and had learned new ways to approach challenges (64%, 41 of 64). Mean resilience scores were lower after the curriculum (72.54 +/- 10.18 versus 68.65 +/- 10.14, P = .034). Feedback from participants indicated that the sessions fostered a sense of togetherness among peers and provided them with an additional support system. CONCLUSIONS : Small group resilience workshops were feasible over 2 years and well received by IM interns, who noted gaining new skills to approach challenges. There was no improvement in resilience scores after the sessions.","1949-8357     Bird, Amber-Nicole     Martinchek, Michelle     Pincavage, Amber T     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2017 Oct;9(5):600-604. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-16-00554.1.

Potentially inappropriate medication (PIM), including over prescription (medication without a valid indication), under prescription (failure to prescribe a clinically indicated drug) and mis-prescription (unwanted drug interaction; incorrect prescribing) is a risk factor for DRPs. PIMCheck (www.pimcheck.org), a prescription screening checklist, was recently developed to detect PIM in internal medicine patients. Purpose This study aimed to determine if electronic application of PIM-Check, used by physicians, can decrease DRPs in internal medicine patients. Material and methods This was an open label prospective study, conducted in two consecutive periods of 1 month, in patients admitted for ?48 hours to seven internal medicine wards in a university hospital. In period 1, patients were treated with usual care (control group). In period 2, patients were treated with usual care preceded by a medication review performed by chief residents within 24 hours after admission using the PIM-Check electronic application (intervention group). At 48 hours, all medications, laboratory results, comorbidities and diagnoses were collected. DRPs were identified by a 'gold standard' group, composed of a clinical pharmacist, clinical pharmacologist and two internal medicine consultants, analysing all patient datasets (blinded to period group). Results 297 patients were included: 188 in the control group and 109 in the intervention group. 909 DRPs (mean/patient ±SD: 3.1±2.2) were identified: 3.2±2.2 in the control group and 2.9±2.2 in the intervention group (p=0.21). Both groups were comparable (age, sex, number of drugs, comorbidities) and had similar mean DRPs/patient. The top 5 active compounds involved in DRPs were: Esomeprazole, paracetamol, tobacco, aspirin and thiamine. In the intervention group, the mean number of statements suggested by PIM-Check was 13.9 ±7/patients. Among the 311 DRPs identified in this group, 33.4% were suggested by PIM-Check but no treatment modifications were performed by prescribers. Conclusion PIM-Check allowed identification of one-third of DRPs. However, the number of DRPs did not decrease significantly in the intervention group. This lack of impact may be explained by the high number of statements displayed and the reluctance of hospital physicians to modify the treatment plan established by the general practitioner for chronic medical conditions, especially in the first 48 hours of hospitalisation.","L617772461     2017-08-18 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

PIM-Check is a screening tool designed to detect PIM in internal medicine patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether PIM-Check could help to identify and reduce DRPs. METHOD: Prospective interventional study conducted on patients admitted to internal medicine wards in a university hospital between 1 September 2015 and 30 October 2015. Adult patients were included if they were hospitalized for more than 48 hours. Patients received either usual care (period 1 = control) or usual care plus medication screening by the wards' chief residents using PIM-Check (period 2 = intervention). An expert panel, composed of a clinical pharmacist, a clinical pharmacologist and two attending physicians in internal medicine, blinded to patient groups, identified DRPs. RESULTS: A total of 297 patients were included (intervention: 109). The groups' demographic parameters were similar. The expert panel identified 909 DRPs (598: control; 311: intervention). The mean number of DRPs per patient was similar in the control (3.2; 95% CI: 2.9-3.5) and intervention groups (2.9; 95% CI: 2.4-3.3) (P = .12). PIM-Check displayed 33.4% of the 311 DRPs identified in the intervention group. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In this study, PIM-Check had limited value, as the average number of DRPs per person was similar in both groups. Although one-third of DRPs counted in intervention group had been identified by PIM-Check, this did not lead to a reduction in DRPs. This lack of impact of PIM-Check on drug prescription may be explained by the number of alerts displayed by the application and hospital physicians' reluctance to modify the treatments for chronic conditions previously prescribed by general practitioners.","1365-2710     Blanc, A-L     Guignard, B     Desnoyer, A     Grosgurin, O     Marti, C     Samer, C     Bonnabry, P     Journal Article     England     J Clin Pharm Ther. 2018 Jul 5. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12733.

Despite the demonstrated value of SDMacross disciplines, little is known about how to increase SDMin general inpatient settings. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational bundle on inpatient resident teams' abilities to demonstrate shared decision-making during morning rounds. METHODS: We completed an IRB-approved pre/post intervention study of SDM on inpatient ward rounds on pediatrics and internal medicine services at two large university-based hospitals. Twelve observers were trained to use a validated, 9-item behavior observation tool, the Rochester Participatory Decision-Making Scale (RPAD, Figure 1) and observed the occurrence of SDM behaviors on inpatient rounds. Interrater reliability was achieved through a series of blinded video calibrations until average SD < 1 on a 9-point scale, and SD < 0.5 per item on a 1-point scale. Data was collected for 12 weeks prior to and 12 weeks following a multimodal educational intervention. This education bundle included three parts: 1) a series of train-the-trainer workshops for residents, chief residents and hospitalist faculty, with interactive role-play exercises and video scenarios to evaluate SDM using the RPAD 2) an educational campaign including pocket cards, screensavers on hospital computers, posters, and email reminders; and 3) an audit and feedback program during morning rounds with observations followed by real-time assessment and feedback. Teams received follow-up electronic communications to reinforce SDM behaviors. Mean scores across all nine RPAD items were calculated, and performance across pediatrics and internal medicine services was compared using ANOVA. RESULTS: In total, 32 teams, 95 ward rounds, and 268 unique patient encounters were observed pre-intervention and 34 teams, 100 ward rounds, and 391 unique patient encounters were observed post-intervention. Both pre- and postgroups were split approximately evenly between pediatrics and internal medicine services. A statistically significant improvement was seen in the four services, with 1.8 mean improvement in RPAD total score on a 9-point scale (range: 0.5 to 2.8, p = <0.05) (Figure 2). CONCLUSIONS: A SDM educational bundled intervention launched over an 8-week period was effective in improving shared decision-making skills in inpatient resident teams across all 4 observed services.

R.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a focused academic support program on American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores and Qualifying Examination (QE) outcomes. METHODS: A mandatory intervention program was begun in April 2001 for residents with ABSITE Total Test (TT) percentiles <31. Program elements included: 1) individual faculty mentoring and personal learning plan 2) QE videotape review sessions 3) Surgical Education and Self-Assessment Program (SESAP) 4) monthly rotation evaluations, and 5) quarterly status feedback. A free medical evaluation was offered. Mock orals participation, educational psychologist consultation, and voluntary followup mentoring were added later. Study data were reviewed for 2003-2005 Chief Residents including ABSITE scores, QE results, conference attendance, rotation Overall Performance ratings, and resident surgeon case volumes. Results were compared for the academic intervention (AI) and no intervention (NI) groups. RESULTS: Fifteen residents graduated during the study period. Eight residents completed nine interventions; seven returned to TT percentiles >30 (7/8, 88%). First post-intervention ABSITE gains were large compared to NI and national peer groups. Standard Score (SS) TT gains were maintained until residency completion by four AI residents. Median AI PGY-5 TT percentile was 32 and three scores were <or=25. Six AI residents (6/8, 75%) and all NI residents (7/7, 100%) passed the QE on their first attempts. AI and NI groups were similar for conference attendance, rotation evaluations, and operative log totals. CONCLUSIONS: A focused academic support intervention for residents with marginal ABSITE TT percentiles can produce immediate substantial gains. Gains are variably maintained through remaining residency years. PGY-5 TT percentiles <or=25, seen with three AI residents (3/8, 38%), are associated with a 40% first QE failure rate. Therefore, our 75% QE first-time pass rate for AI residents argues for intervention success.","Borman, Karen R     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2006 Nov-Dec;63(6):367-72. doi: 10.1016/j.cursur.2006.06.007.

DESIGN: Prospective, voluntary, national survey conducted April through May, 2008, in which finishing chief residents rated the importance of 12 factors in their decision making to pursue fellowships. SETTING: General surgery chief residents who applied for admission to the American Board of Surgery Qualifying Examination process. PARTICIPANTS: All 1034 first-time applicants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: chi(2) tests and 1-way analyses of variance were used to correlate gender and residency type, size, and location with summed values and scaled mean scores for ratings of the importance of 12 potential factors in fellowship decision making. RESULTS: The fellowship rate was 77% and correlated with residency size and location. Women were dispersed asymmetrically across residencies overall but future female fellows were distributed similarly to male ones. Survey item response rates for future fellows were 96% to 98%. Clinical mastery and specialty activities were valued most highly by more than 90% of men and women. Men placed more value on income potential and spousal influence. Lifestyle factors reached only midrange importance for both genders. Program size had more significant relationships to decision-making factors than did gender. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to master an area of clinical practice and the clinical activities of a specialty are the most important factors for chief residents in fellowship decision making, regardless of gender. Lifestyle factors are of midrange importance. Program size is as influential as is gender.","1538-3644     Borman, Karen R     Biester, Thomas W     Rhodes, Robert S     Journal Article     United States     Arch Surg. 2010 Jul;145(7):671-8. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.2010.116.

We examine whether perceived subspecialty content, dedicated services, and fellows impact fellowship choices. METHODS: Specialty content was assessed through a survey linking 228 operations to 9 content areas. The presence of dedicated services and fellows and the post-residency activities of graduates 1997-2006 were collected from 2 program directors. RESULTS: A total of 75% of residents (26 University of Mississippi, UM; 22 Vanderbilt University, VU) completed surveys. Five dedicated services and 2 fellowships at UM and VU were identical; VU had an additional 4 services and 3 fellowships. UM and VU residents similarly associated 184 operations (81%) with General Surgery. Agreement was not linked to services or fellows. A total of 44% of UM graduates and 68% of VU graduates pursued fellowships. The top choice at UM was Plastic/Hand (14%, versus 6% VU) and Oncology/Endocrine at VU (19%, versus 2% UM). Differences in specialties selected could not be linked consistently to dedicated services or fellows. CONCLUSION: Dedicated services and fellows appear to have little impact on fellowship specialty selection by chief residents. There may be a generic effect of dedicated services favoring fellowship versus no fellowship. Differential faculty mentoring skills may influence specific fellowship choices.","1095-8673     Borman, Karen R     Vick, Laura R     Dattilo, Jeffery B     Tarpley, John L     Mitchell, Marc E     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Res. 2009 Jun 15;154(2):274-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2008.05.027.

Nelsen and Haines, P. and Bennett, N.",,eng,,,"The Golisano Children's Hospital at Upstate Medical University is a 71 bed children's hospital within a hospital, serving nearly two million people in Central New York. Minor procedures occur daily in all children's hospitals, yet team coordination when planning for these procedures is often overlooked. LEAPP is a mnemonic for: Listen, Evaluate, Anticipate, Plan, and Proceed. The ""Look before You LEAPP"" program was developed by a group of nurses, child life specialists, faculty, a chief resident and a fellow. LEAPP is a team-based program providing consistent care to all children undergoing inpatient procedures. It improves patient satisfaction and reduces procedural distress. Through LEAPP steps, teams are created at point of care - at the bedside or treatment room of inpatient units. Educational goals are linked to the practical goal of cooperation for good health care. The approach uses an online educational module for residents, students and nurses to introduce an innovative protocol and a planning tool.1 Pocket cards, promotional pens, and logo door-clings, purchased through grant funds (The Foundation for Upstate Medical University) were initially used to encourage participation. Pre/post observations of procedural planning and performance of the nurse, caregiver, physician, child-life specialist and independent observer included patient and family preparation, pain and anxiety, staffing and supplies, and satisfaction. Fifty procedures were assessed pre-implementation and 28 post implementation. Although satisfaction with procedures improved between pre and post LEAPP implementation, there were overall differences in satisfaction with procedural management and pain/anxiety control by physicians, caregivers, and staff that remained statistically significant. Interdisciplinary bedside teamwork can be used to support interprofessional education and this education can similarly be used to support improved patient outcomes.","Botash, Ann S     Jeski, Michelle     Baish Cameron, Colleen     K Nelsen, Elizabeth     Haines, Pamela     Bennett, Nicholas     Journal Article     England     BMJ Qual Improv Rep. 2013 Sep 27;2(1). pii: bmjquality_u632_w1249. doi: 10.1136/bmjquality.u632.w1249. eCollection 2013.

In our 2002 national survey, pediatric resident education about medical error prevention was sporadic. We sought to describe the amount and type of pediatric resident training about medical errors and to assess the change in training since 2002. METHODS: We surveyed a national sample of 50 pediatric chief residents randomly selected from the 198 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited residency programs from August to November 2010. The 31-item telephone survey was developed from the 2002 survey, with the addition of 10 items about electronic learning and resident quality improvement projects. The survey included 4 domains: current patient safety curriculum, chief resident knowledge, learning from medical errors, and demographics. RESULTS: We phoned 55 chief residents and contacted 51. Fifty participated (90% participation rate). Ninety-four percent of chief residents stated that their program had a formalized curriculum to discuss medical errors, compared to only 50% (P < .001) in 2002. Ninety-six percent understood that the response to a medical error should be systemic change. The primary method for educating residents about medical error reported was informal teaching. Ninety-two percent reported never or rarely discussing medical error in an outpatient setting. Seventy-four percent of chief residents reported that they never or rarely learn from an error made by an attending physician, and 50% never or rarely learned from an error made by a fellow resident. CONCLUSIONS: Although resident education about medical errors has improved since 2002, opportunities to model learning from mistakes are frequently missed.","1876-2867     Bradley, Corey K     Fischer, Melissa A     Walsh, Kathleen E     Journal Article     United States     Acad Pediatr. 2013 Jan-Feb;13(1):59-64. doi: 10.1016/j.acap.2012.10.004.

RESULTS: The mean knowledge test scores for the intervention group, both before and after undergoing the structured palliative care curriculum, were no different from the comparison group. There was also no difference in objective structured clinical examination scores between the 2 groups. The intervention group felt less comfortable managing pain, breaking bad news, or addressing ethical issues. CONCLUSIONS: Junior surgical residents have similar palliative care knowledge to senior residents without a palliative care curriculum. After participating in a palliative care curriculum, they have simulated skills that are similar to chief residents.

E. and Ciocca, R. G. and Gerard Crowley, J. and Graham, A. M.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: As endovascular procedures develop, there is a risk of diminished training of residents and fellows in traditional open surgery. We evaluated the effect of our endovascular program, initiated in 1999 coincident with the Federal Drug Administration's approval of endoluminal vascular aortic grafts, on the number of endovascular procedures and open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs performed in comparison to national trends. METHODS: The experience of vascular fellows and chief residents at completion of training (1996-2002) was reviewed and compared with the national mean case numbers before and after initiation of our endovascular program. RESULTS: The development of an endovascular program increased the total number of aneurysms repaired at the Robert Wood Johnson (RWJ) Medical School from 49 +/- 15 to 92 +/- 8 per year (P < 0.01). The number of vascular operations performed by the RWJ fellow increased from 320 +/- 48 to 553 +/- 155 per year (P < 0.05). The number of operations performed nationally by vascular fellows also increased during the same period, but did not reach statistical significance. There was no change in the number of open AAA repairs performed by the RWJ fellow or nationally. There was also no change in the average number of vascular operations completed by RWJ chief residents or nationally (160 +/- 17 versus 157 +/- 1 and 192 +/- 4 versus 189 +/- 4, respectively; P > 0.05). However, the average number of open AAA repairs performed nationally by general surgical chief residents decreased from 10 +/- 0.3 to 9 +/- 0.4 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: An endovascular program can increase the total number of AAA repairs performed without influencing the total number of vascular operations performed by general surgical chief residents. There was a decrease in open AAA repairs performed nationally by general surgical chief residents. The advancement of endovascular therapies may decrease the number of open procedures available for trainees in both general and vascular surgery. Perhaps those that will specialize in the field of vascular surgery should have the benefit of those open procedures.","Brevetti, Lucy S     Nackman, Gary B     Shindelman, Larry E     Ciocca, Rocco G     Gerard Crowley, J     Graham, Alan M     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Res. 2003 Nov;115(1):100-5.

METHODS: At the University of Tennessee Medical Center-Knoxville, in addition to resident-performed teaching cases, some cases are performed without the assistance of residents by the same faculty. RESULTS: Sixty-two case categories involving 14,452 cases were compared for operative times alone. In 46 case categories (10,787 procedures), resident operative times were longer than faculty alone. In 16 case categories, resident operating times were shorter than faculty times. The net incremental operative time cost was 2,050 hours between July 1993 and March 1997. Assuming 4 years of operative training for 11 graduating chief residents, the cost per graduating resident was $47,970. CONCLUSION: Extrapolated to a national annual cost for the 1,014 general surgery residents who completed training in the 1997 academic year, the annual cost of training residents in the operating room is $53 million. This high monetary cost suggests the need for digital skills, selection criteria, the development of training curriculum and resource facilities, the pre-operating room need for suturing and stapling techniques, and perhaps the acquisition of virtual surgery training modules.","Bridges, M     Diamond, D L     Journal Article     United States     Am J Surg. 1999 Jan;177(1):28-32.

Cases were categorized as biopsy, extra-axial/skull base, intra-axial, or transsphenoidal. Complications were categorized as neurologic, medical, wound, mortality, or none and compared for patients managed by a chief resident vs a consultant neurosurgeon. RESULTS: A total of 6277 neurosurgical procedures for intracranial neoplasms were performed. After excluding radiosurgical procedures and pediatric patients, 4151 adult patients who underwent 4423 procedures were available for analysis. Complications were infrequent, with overall rates of 9.8% (435 of 4423 procedures), 1.7% (73 of 4423), and 1.4% (63 of 4423) for neurologic, medical, and wound complications, respectively. The rate of perioperative mortality was 0.3% (14 of 4423 procedures). Case performance and management by a chief resident did not negatively impact outcome.

A. and Shah, S. and Siddiqi, K. and Boyd, B.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the amount of training necessary for a midcareer urologic surgeon to incorporate hand-assisted laparoscopic (HAL) renal surgery into an academic practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A urologist (JAB) without laparoscopic surgical experience in his fifth year of practice completed a 3-month minifellowship at a high-volume center primarily to learn HAL nephrectomy (HALN), during which he performed 15 HALNs (and 2 HAL nephroureterectomies) and assisted during 5 HALNs. Surgical outcomes and resident surgical participation on nephrectomy cases at the home medical center during the 6 months prior to (phase 1) and after (phase 2) the fellowship were evaluated. RESULTS: During phase 1, 12 open nephrectomies were performed in a mean operative time of 265 (10-387) minutes. During phase 2, 16 HALNs were initiated and 2 (13%) combined cases were converted to open at the discretion of general surgeon. The mean operative time was 288 (226-355) minutes. Ten (10) and 5 patients from each cohort had concomitant procedures performed. The mean tumor size was 8.7 (2-15) and 7.1 (2.5-15) cm. Three (3) patients from each cohort were anemic preoperatively (hemoglobin < or =10 mg/dL). Ten (10) (83%) and 4 (25%) patients from each cohort received transfusions. There were 3 and 2 intraoperative and postoperative cohort complications, respectively. Residents were the operative surgeon on all cohort 1 and two thirds of cohort 2 cases. Chief residents completed the entirety of their third and fourth HALNs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-month fellowship is an effective tool for a midcareer urologist to rapidly gain significant HALN experience. Twenty-two (22) cases (17 as surgeon) allowed for the immediate incorporation of this procedure into a complex academic practice without any interruption of residency training.","Brown, James A     Shah, Sagar     Siddiqi, Kashif     Boyd, Buffi     Journal Article     United States     J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A. 2007 Aug;17(4):435-9. doi: 10.1089/lap.2006.0130.

Chief residents at 21 institutions were surveyed by phone or in person. Directors of residency programs in the Graduate Medical Education Directory received the survey electronically. RESULTS: Responses were received from 99 (68 university, 31 private practice) of the 203 programs. Nine (9%) reported both a decreased number of residents and a subsequent increase in call obligations. First-year residents generally began to accept calls with a senior resident or alone at a median of 6 months, although 15 (48%) private practice programs required them to accept calls alone before this time. First-year residents at university programs (31%) were more likely to assume call duties during the first 6 months accompanied by a senior resident.

F., Jr. and Kam, D. and Carey, M. and Dean, R. E.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The management of trauma patients has become increasingly nonoperative, especially for solid abdominal organ injuries. However, the Residency Review Committee (RRC) still requires an operative trauma experience deemed essential for graduating general surgical residents. The purpose of this study was to review the trauma volume and mix of patients at two trauma centers and determine the major operative trauma cases available to residents involved in the care of these patients. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at the two trauma centers used by the Michigan State University surgery residency. Both of the trauma centers are American College of Surgeons verified. Surgical residents are involved with the care of every trauma patient at each of the hospitals. Cumulative data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 1999. Age, gender, mechanism of injury (blunt vs. penetrating), Injury Severity Score, length of stay, operative interventions, and patients managed nonoperatively were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 434 patients selected for this study from 2,340 patients admitted to the trauma services. Male patients accounted for 66% of patients and female patients accounted for 34% of patients. Blunt trauma was the mechanism in 89% of patients, with penetrating trauma accounting for the other 11% of patients. Of the total number of patients, motor vehicle crashes accounted for the majority of cases, 325 of 434 (75%). Overall, 85% (370 of 434) of patients were managed without an index trauma surgical procedure according to RRC guidelines. Only 14.7% (64 of 434) of patients underwent operative intervention that qualified as index trauma surgical cases identified by the RRC. The spleen and small bowel were the two most commonly injured organs found at laparotomy. Nonoperative intervention of many patients with solid abdominal organ injuries did not meet the operation requirements expected by the RRC. CONCLUSION: Our residency program had 10 graduating chief residents over the 3-year time period. With only 64 operative trauma cases, this yields an average of 6.4 trauma cases per resident. This falls significantly short of the 16-case minimum requirement in trauma surgery established by the RRC. The operative trauma requirements established by the RRC for graduating residents may be unattainable in many residency programs because of the high incidence of blunt trauma and the changing patterns of trauma management.","Bulinski, Patrick     Bachulis, Ben     Naylor, Douglas F Jr     Kam, David     Carey, Mark     Dean, Richard E     Journal Article     United States     J Trauma. 2003 Jan;54(1):161-3. doi: 10.1097/01.TA.0000033495.49930.A5.

METHODS: During the first 5 years, educational conferences were didactic lectures delivered by the attending thoracic surgery staff (group 1, n = 9 residents). During the second 5 years, residents prepared and delivered reviews from major textbook sources (group 2, n = 9 residents). Scores on the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) as a chief resident in general surgery were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance to assess fund of knowledge and test-taking skills prior to thoracic surgery training for the two groups.

I.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71297529,English,,,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Medication reconciliation at hospital admission and discharge is critical to patient safety; many institutions have difficulty ensuring consistent provider compliance. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): 1. Obtain a high physician compliance rate with admission medication reconciliation after launch of a new, computer order entry (CPOE) based system. 2. Sustain this high rate of compliance. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONALCONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): In spring of 2011 our institution transitioned from a paper-based medication reconciliation process to one embedded in our CPOE. Initial house staff compliance after launch, which included education and groupbased orientation/training, was zero percent. Further educational efforts such as noon conferences by the residency program did not improve compliance. We then started twice weekly audits of our 14 inpatient medicine teams. A minimum of 10 patient charts per resident team were randomly selected for audit via computer. Results were made public to entire house staff via group email. Accountability for results was assigned to the PGY-2/3 level residents. Those who achieved high compliance rates were praised in the program wide email by name from the residency program leadership (>90% compliance warranted strong praise, 100% compliance resulted in highest praise). Lower performing residents were not singled out by name in the email but were approached and counseled individually by a program director or chief resident. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVEMETRICSWHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): Success was determined by the percentage of patient charts for which the medication reconciliation form was completed within 24 hours of admission. An overall goal of >95% compliance was set. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): After implementation of our feedback and reporting program overall compliance rose steadily, and at 6 months compliance was sustained at over 95%. A Joint Commission visit occurred during this time, in which medication reconciliation was noted by the inspectors to be an institutional strength. After a two month break in the auditing process, a follow up audit to check for sustained effect revealed that average compliance had fallen to 69.5%. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): The Hawthorne Effect, first described by psychologists in the 1930's studying workers at the Hawthorne Works factory, is generally accepted as a method for improving compliance. It states that individual behaviors will improve in the setting of known monitoring. Physicians are increasingly being held individually accountable for quality and patient safety outcomes, often with data reported in a public way. The ACGME requires that residents be involved in patient safety and quality improvement initiatives, and that they receive data on the outcomes of patients specifically under their care. Our intervention combined all 3 of these principles and found that an email based public reporting system improved and sustained compliance with a new admission medication reconciliation process. Withdrawal of this system likely led to a drop off in compliance. This approach was effective but may need to be done on a permanent or more long-term basis to effect durable change. In addition, such an approach might be effective in increasing housestaff compliance with other behaviors (for example, completion of medical records, evaluations, etc).","L71297529     2014-01-24 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

One popular approach is a mini-journal club format, where residents are given a clinical question and they must find and present an article relevant to the question. One problem with this approach is that the article rather than the patient is the main focus of the discussion. We created a debate format for evidence-based medicine. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The residents who had participated in the mini-journal club format were surveyed. We changed to the debate format and asked the residents who participated in the debate format the same survey questions. We assessed our six ward teams. DESCRIPTION: For the debate format, every month, over three days, two teams at a time debated a clinical question. The question was announced when they arrived for the debate. They were assigned to argue either the affirmative or the negative. The team was allowed 30 minutes to research the medical literature and create their argument, 8 minutes to argue their side, 4 minutes for rebuttal, and 3 minutes for summation. After the debate, an attending, two chief residents, and a third year resident discussed how the evidence was obtained, its quality, and the strengths and weakness of each side. Awinning team was chosen each month. EVALUATION: Twenty-two residents answered the mini-journal club survey and 43 residents answered the debate format. Seven questions were asked, five of which were not significantly different between the journal club and debate formats. The two key questions were: This exercise was a valuable use of my time. and For the amount of time I put into the exercise, I received a commensurate increase in learning. The residents felt that the value was greater for the debate format (lower scores were better, journal club, mean 2.0; debate, mean 1.67; p=0.035, two-sided) and they felt that the debate was a good use of their time (lower is better, journal club, mean 2.0; debate, mean 1.60; p=0.048, two-sided). DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Residents felt that the debate-style format was more valuable and a better use of their time than the mini-journal club format. Out goal is to create a format that requires the residents to obtain, synthesize, and use evidence-based clinical information in real time so that they can use this skill both in the hospital and in outpatient clinic. We believe that out debate format provides a realistic approach for achieving our goal that the residents find valuable and a good use of their time.","L71297539     2014-01-24 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

P.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: The frequency of chief resident positions in pharmacy residency programs and the roles and responsibilities of such chief residents are described. METHODS: A Web-based questionnaire was developed to determine the current state and interest of residency program directors (RPDs) in chief residency programs within pharmacy residency training. RPDs were identified through directories of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and the American College of Clinical Pharmacy. RESULTS: Of the 892 surveys distributed, 34 were returned as undeliverable and 335 responses were received (effective response rate, 39.0%). Over one quarter of respondents (28.4%) had a chief resident, resident-in-charge, or other leadership position for residents at their institution. Institutions with existing chief resident programs had larger programs. Common duties of the chief resident included serving as a liaison between residents and the RPD (91.4%), coordinating resident meetings (87.1%), coordinating educational programming (45.2%), and managing residents' schedules (44.1%). RPDs indicated interest in training programs designed to develop management skills and enhance leadership potential (72.7%). Of those RPDs whose institutions did not off er a chief resident position, 22% expressed interest in developing such a position. Programs with four or more residents were more likely to be interested in developing a chief residency program than those with smaller programs (34.3% versus 13.2%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The majority of RPDs stated that their residency programs do not currently have a chief resident position. Programs with a greater number of pharmacy residents were more likely to have a current chief resident position or interest in establishing a chief resident position.","Burkiewicz, Jill S     Bruce, Susan P     Journal Article     United States     Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2007 Apr 1;64(7):754-61. doi: 10.2146/ajhp060536.

M. and Hall, S. and Baz, S. and Kessler, T. and Roman, M. and Patuszynski, M. and Thakkar, K. and Kashner, T. M.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: Preparing residents for future practice, knowledge, and skills in quality improvement and safety (QI/S) is a requisite element of graduate medical education. Despite many challenges, residency programs must consider new curricular innovations to meet the requirements. We report the effectiveness of a primary care QI/S curriculum and the role of the chief resident in quality and patient safety in facilitating it. METHOD: Through the Veterans Administration Graduate Medical Education Enhancement Program, we added a position for a chief resident in quality and patient safety, and 4 full-time equivalent internal medicine residents, to develop the Primary Care Interprofessional Patient-Centered Quality Care Training Curriculum. The curriculum includes a first-or second-year, 1-month block rotation that serves as a foundational experience in QI/S and interprofessional care. The responsibilities of the chief resident in quality and patient safety included organizing and teaching the QI/S curriculum and mentoring resident projects. Evaluation included prerotation and postrotation surveys of self-assessed QI/S knowledge, abilities, skills, beliefs, and commitment (KASBC); an end-of-the-year KASBC; prerotation and postrotation knowledge test; and postrotation and faculty surveys. RESULTS: Comparisons of prerotation and postrotation KASBC indicated significant self-assessed improvements in 4 of 5 KASBC domains: knowledge (P < .001), ability (P < .001), skills (P < .001), and belief (P < .03), which were sustained on the end-of-the-year survey. The knowledge test demonstrated increased QI/S knowledge (P = .002). Results of the postrotation survey indicate strong satisfaction with the curriculum, with 76% (25 of 33) and 70% (23 of 33) of the residents rating the quality and safety curricula as always or usually educational. Most faculty members acknowledged that the chief resident in quality and patient safety enhanced both faculty and resident QI/S interest and participation in projects. CONCLUSIONS: Our primary care QI/S curriculum was associated with improved and persistent resident self-perceived knowledge, abilities, and skills and increased knowledge-based scores of QI/S. The chief resident in quality and patient safety played an important role in overseeing the curriculum, teaching, and providing leadership.","Byrne, John M     Hall, Susan     Baz, Sam     Kessler, Todd     Roman, Maher     Patuszynski, Mark     Thakkar, Kruti     Kashner, T Michael     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2012 Dec;4(4):510-5. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-11-00322.1.

METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to all accredited VSR programs and their associated GS programs in the United States and Canada in 2001 (survey 1) and in 2003 (survey 2) and to 2 medical schools with VSR programs in 2001. A total of 197 VSRs, 169 GS-CRs, and 78 MSs responded (overall program response rate of 78% for VSRs, 46% for GSRs, 20% for MSs). A scoring system was assigned, with 1.0 the least important and 5.0 the most important reasons to choose or not choose vascular surgery. RESULTS: Technical aspects, role of mentors, and complex decision making involved in vascular surgery were the most important reasons that VSRs, GS-CRs, and MSs would choose vascular surgery as a specialty (average scores > or =4.0 for VSRs and GS-CRs; > or =3.5 for MSs). Responses of GS-CRs and VSRs did not vary significantly between surveys 1 and 2, except endovascular capabilities of vascular surgeons had a more important role in choosing vascular surgery, and future loss of patients to other interventionalists had a more important role in not choosing this specialty in the more recent survey of GS-CRs and VSRs. MSs identified lifestyle as a surgical resident (4.3) and as a surgeon (4.2) as the most important negative factors. A training paradigm consisting of 4 years general surgery + 2 years vascular surgery with a GS certificate was favored by 64% of GS-CRs and 48% of VSRs, compared with a paradigm of 5 years + 2 years with a general surgery certificate, which was favored by 29% of GS-CRs and 25% of VSRs, or 3 years + 3 years without a general surgery certificate, favored by 7% of GS-CRs and 27% of VSRs. Of note, 86% of MSs favored 3 years general surgery + 3 years vascular surgery or 2 years general surgery + 4 years vascular surgery compared with longer general surgery training periods. CONCLUSION: These findings may help vascular surgery program directors devise strategies to attract future trainees. The importance of mentorship to general surgery junior residents and medical students in choosing vascular surgery cannot be overestimated. Endovascular capabilities of vascular surgeons have an increasingly positive role in career choice by GS-CRs and VSRs, but these residents express increasing concerns about potential loss of patients to other specialists. Lifestyle concerns are the most important reasons why medical students do not choose vascular surgery as a career.","Calligaro, Keith D     Dougherty, Matthew J     Sidawy, Anton N     Cronenwett, Jack L     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     J Vasc Surg. 2004 Nov;40(5):978-84. doi: 10.1016/j.jvs.2004.08.036.

Asurvey assessing perspectives on autonomy from graduates of the University of Minnesota pediatric residency program in 2017 revealed a perception of insufficient autonomy with only 31% of graduates reporting discussion of expectations for autonomy and leadership with their attendings. OBJECTIVE: Develop and implement strategies for promoting senior resident autonomy during inpatient pediatric rotations through education and coaching with chief residents on site. METHODS: Chief residents at two academic children's hospitals incorporated brief coaching sessions for senior residents during orientation at the beginning of each rotation. Senior residents were encouraged to: (1) discuss expectations of team leadership with their attending, (2) position themselves on rounds to encourage junior trainees to present to them, and (3) speak first in rounds when communicating with families. Chief residents observed rounds to provide direct feedback to residents. Residents completed a survey at rotation end regarding which techniques they used and whether they discussed expectations. RESULTS: Since the implementation of chief resident-led coaching, 33 senior residents have rotated through the two hospitals, of which, 88% completed post-intervention surveys. 52% of residents reported that they consistently set expectations with their attending physician and 41% cited improved autonomy as a result of this. 34% of senior residents perceived increased autonomy when oral presentations were directed at them. CONCLUSIONS: With chief resident coaching, more senior residents are discussing expectations with their attendings at the start of their inpatient rotations. As a result of these conversations and small behavioral modifications, resident perceptions of autonomy have increased. Increasing empowerment and autonomy of senior residents improves meaningfulness and competency leading to confident, independent pediatricians.","L623224005     2018-07-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>true} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: May be relevant, need to read"

DESIGN: A nine-item instrument was used to evaluate students' clinical skills. Raters were also asked to provide a grade of each student's overall clinical performance. Generalizability studies were performed to estimate the reliability of the ratings. The effects of rater experience and clerkship setting were investigated by regression analysis. SETTING: Teaching hospitals and community-based sites in three Northwestern states. PARTICIPANTS: All students (328) who had completed the 12-week clerkship in internal medicine at one medical school during the academic years 1987-1989. Raters included attending physicians, chief residents, and other residents. RESULTS: Seven observations were needed to provide a reliable rating of the overall clinical grade. More observations were needed to obtain reliable ratings for individual items, ranging from seven observations needed for the rating of data gathering skills to 27 observations needed for the rating of interpersonal relationships with patients. Rater experience and clerkship setting (i.e., teaching hospitals vs. community-based clinics) were found, in general, not to affect significantly the ratings received by students. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable ratings of students' overall clinical skills, including overall clinical grades, can be achieved by collecting a minimum of seven observations. More observations are needed to measure reliably the interpersonal aspects of clinical performance. These findings support the use of performance ratings to evaluate clinical skills and knowledge of students in clerkship settings.","Carline, J D     Paauw, D S     Thiede, K W     Ramsey, P G     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Gen Intern Med. 1992 Sep-Oct;7(5):506-10.

The aim of this study is to analyze the national trends in the number of endoscopy cases performed by graduating general surgery residents in light of the new minimum requirement. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of endoscopy case numbers from the ACGME logs for graduating residents from all US general surgery residency programs was performed (1999- 2010). Procedure categories were analyzed for trends over time using segmented linear regression. Davies test was used to determine if a breakpoint existed with a p-value of 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Analysis of the number of endoscopy cases as a continuous variable revealed a statistical break point suggesting division of the time period of the study into two groups: Group I (1999-2007) and Group II (2008-2010). Within Group I, we noted a decrease in the number of cases in most categories although only a few reached statistical significance (Table). In contrast within Group II, we detected a statistically significant increase in the number of cases in all noted categories. This increase in the number of cases from Group I to Group II corresponded to the time point when the minimum number of endoscopy cases required to graduate was increased from 29 to 85. (Table Presented) CONCLUSIONS: General surgery residency programs have responded appropriately within a short span of time to enable graduating general surgery residents to satisfy the increased minimum case requirements for endoscopy.","L71167448     2013-09-23

"",Comparing self-perceived cross-cultural skillfulness between physicians and nurses at a swiss university hospital: Does provider role make a difference?,2013,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,28,,S50,"Casillas, A. and Paroz, S. and Green, A. and Wolff, H. and Bodenmann, P.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71292706,English,,,"BACKGROUND: As the diversity of the Swiss population evolves, measuring providers' cultural competency and understanding what contextual factors may influence this skillfulness is necessary. We compared perceived skillfulness and explanatory predictors between physicians and nurses at one of five university hospitals. Given a lack of study on the effect of provider role, this was doubly relevant from a Swiss perspective, where nurse practitioners are increasingly assuming clinical responsibilities for vulnerable patients. METHODS: A 64-item cultural competency questionnaire, including translated/back-translated items from the validated survey, 'Residency training in cross-cultural care,' was mailed in November 2010 to residents, chief residents and nurses working in patient-care units at Lausanne's university hospital. Using Student's t-tests, we compared physicians' and nurses' mean composite scores for the nine self-perceived skillfulness items (4-point Likert-scale), and proportion of '3-good/4-very good' responses using Chi-square tests. We used linear regression to examine how provider role (physician vs. nurse) was associated with composite scores, adjusting for demographics (gender, non-French dominant language), workplace (time at institution, work-unit 'sensitized' to cultural-care), items on reported cultural-competence training, and on cross-cultural care problemawareness. We subsequently stratified analyses to physicians and nurses, alone. We present results significant at the p=0.05 level. RESULTS: Of 885 mailed questionnaires, 371 individuals (41.2 %) returned the completed survey: 123 (33.6 %) physicians and 239 (66.4 %) nurses, reflecting the distribution of providers in the institution. Physicians were more likely to be male, have worked at the institution for less than 5 years, have more training experiences, and more problem-awareness regarding cross-cultural care. They had better mean composite scores for perceived skillfulness than nurses (2.7 vs. 2.5, p=.0005), and significantly higher proportion of 'good/very good' responses for 4/9 items. After adjusting for explanatory variables, physicians remained more likely to have higher skillfulness (?=0.13, p=.049). Among all, two problemawareness items were significantly correlated with higher skillfulness: inadequate cross-cultural training (?=0.14, p=.012) and lack of practical experience caring for diverse populations (?=0.11, p=.040). Among physicians alone, having a non-French dominant language (?=0.34, p=.000), and problem-awareness about inadequate cross-cultural training (?=0.22, p=.003), were positively correlated with skillfulness. Among nurses alone, having received training on the history/culture of a specific group (?=0.25, p=.016) was associated with skillfulness, as was problemawareness about the lack of practical experience caring for diverse populations (?=0.16, p=.037). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, perceived cross-cultural skillfulness among Lausanne providers was low. Physicians had higher skillfulness than nurses, even after adjustment. Having a non-native dominant language was associated with skillfulness among physicians, emphasizing diversity in the medical workforce as important for improving patient care. Among all providers, problem-awareness about cross-cultural care was positively associated with skillfulness. Thus, attuning providers' awareness to the surrounding problems in cross-cultural patient-care, can improve skillfulness- especially among nurses with rising responsibilities.","L71292706     2014-01-28 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

28460596,Using Objective Structured Teaching Encounters (OSTEs) to prepare chief residents to be emotionally intelligent leaders,2017,1,1,Med Educ Online,,22,1,1320186,"Cerrone, S. A. and Adelman, P. and Akbar, S. and Yacht, A. C. and Fornari, A.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Chief Residents must lead, manage and mentor a diverse and often large group of residents, however there is a lack of formal leadership training throughout graduate medical education. OBJECTIVE: Development of a 3-part Chief Resident (CR) Program focused on leading, managing and mentoring. DESIGN: Each participant completes an Emotional Intelligence (EI) Inventory prior to the day-long event. Participants receive their EI scores at the beginning of the program, which features interactive sessions on leadership, management, and feedback skills. The program then reinforces the application of their new knowledge about EI through a four station OSTE (Observed Structured Teaching Encounter). CRs practice feedback and coaching skills in a simulated environment where they need to provide the context of formative feedback to a standardized resident. RESULTS: The aggregated mean pre-session EI score for all participants was 76.9 (an ideal score is >85). An independent-samples t-test compared the CRs' leadership and feedback performance on their first and second OSTE performance within a single afternoon session. There was a significant difference between the first OSTE performance (M = 47.92, SD = 7.8) and the second OSTE performance (M = 51.22, SD = 6.9); t (68) = 1.99, p = 0.006. These results suggest that participating in multiple OSTEs positively reinforces the core interpersonal and communication skills discussed in the didactic and practiced in the interactive portions of the program. CONCLUSION: The low mean pre-session EI score achieved by our participants supports the idea that CRs enter their new roles with a level of EI that can be enhanced. CRs had an overall positive reaction to EI and its application to the core skills addressed in the program, highlighting the fact that similar programs could be used to train early career physicians to be more skilled and comfortable with leading, managing and mentoring.

OBJECTIVE: To assess residents' self-reported improvement in teaching skills after feedback based on direct observation of work rounds. METHOD: The authors initiated a program of direct observation of residents' teaching during work rounds during the academic year 2007-2008. Eleven interested faculty volunteers, including chief residents, observed teaching on work rounds by 18 second-year residents in internal medicine during 35 total encounters. Within 24 hours, the faculty observers provided individualized feedback to the resident teachers regarding the quantity and quality of their teaching based on the data collected with the Teaching on Work Rounds observation form. At the end of the year, a survey was conducted to assess the residents' receptivity to this program. RESULTS: Each observation averaged 92 minutes per observer, for 81.5 recorded hours of observations. Eighty percent of the residents felt that they were better teachers because of the feedback they received, and 87% subsequently reported having made conscious changes in their teaching during work rounds. DISCUSSION: A direct observation program of residents' teaching on work rounds improved residents' interest in teaching while motivating them to make conscious changes in their teaching based on the individualized feedback they received.","Chandler, Daniel     Snydman, Laura K     Rencic, Joseph     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2012 Sep;4(3):374-7. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-11-00206.1.

METHODS: An ethnographic study was conducted that included interviews with 10 nurses and participant observation in an open heart surgery unit with 59 nurses and two surgical teams during a 2-year period. RESULTS: Nurses and physicians were organized in hierarchies of nurse manager, resource nurse, charge nurse, and staff nurse or attending surgeon, fellow, chief resident, and resident. These parallel hierarchies allowed for checks on judgment both within and across professional lines. Rituals, such as nursing report, physician rounds, and flow sheet use, provided a context for a critique on judgment processes. Communication of judgment was frequently a casual, open conversation. At other times, differences in perspective could result in conflict. Communication between nurses and physicians has been associated with better patient outcomes. Critical care unit directors and managers can use an analysis of communication patterns to develop supports to clinical judgment.","Chase, S K     Journal Article     United States     Heart Lung. 1995 Mar-Apr;24(2):154-62.

Despite increased use (100% of our surveyed residents reported using a dermatoscope), dermoscopy training is one of the aspects of United States dermatology residency training with the lowest resident satisfaction [2]. Diagnostic accuracy with dermoscopy is highly correlated with the amount of dermoscopy training the user has undertaken [3]. We sought to analyze dermoscopy use in US Dermatology residencies to better understand resident dermoscopy utilization and teaching modalities. We found residents learn dermoscopy via multiple teaching modalities. The most commonly reported dermoscopy teaching modality was didactic lectures, followed by time in clinic with a dermoscopy expert. Of the different teaching modalities, time in the clinic with a dermoscopy expert was reported to be the most effective. We also found that the majority of dermatology residents receive didactic dermoscopy lectures and clinical dermoscopy training on the differentiation of benign nevi from melanoma using dermoscopy, the detection of basal cell carcinoma, and the identification of seborrheic keratosis.

M.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: To examine the case mix and patient characteristics and outcomes of the nontrauma emergency (NTE) service in an academic Division of Acute Care Surgery. METHODS: An NTE service (attending, chief resident, postgraduate year-3 and postgraduate year-2 residents, and two physician assistants) was created in July 2005 for all urgent and emergent inpatient and emergency department general surgery patient consults and admissions. An NTE database was created with prospective data collection of all NTE admissions initiated from November 1, 2007. Prospective data were collected by a dedicated trauma registrar and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-intensive care unit (ICU) coordinator daily. NTE case mix and ICU characteristics were reviewed for the 2-year time period January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2009. During the same time period, trauma operative cases and procedures were examined and compared with the NTE case mix. RESULTS: Thousand seven hundred eight patients were admitted to the NTE service during this time period (789 in 2008 and 910 in 2009). Surgical intervention was required in 70% of patients admitted to the NTE service. Exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy was performed in 449 NTE patients, comprising 37% of all surgical procedures. In comparison, only 118 trauma patients (5.9% of admissions) required a major laparotomy or thoracotomy during the same time period. Acuity of illness of NTE patients was high, with a significant portion (13%) of NTE patients requiring ICU admission. NTE patients had higher admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III scores [61.2 vs. 58.8 (2008); 58.2 vs. 55.8 (2009)], increased mortality [(9.71% vs. 4.89% (2008); 6.78% vs. 5.16% (2009)], and increased readmission rates (15.5% vs. 7.4%) compared with the total surgical ICU (SICU) admissions. CONCLUSION: In an era of declining operative caseload in trauma, the NTE service provides ample opportunity for complex general surgery decision making and operative procedures for surgical residency education, including advanced surgical critical care management.

L. and Nagdee, I. and Wei, L. and Koyle, M. A.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L617744001,English,,,"Background: Effective handovers are important components of patient care. Numerous studies demonstrate a clear association between the quality and quantity of handover information, and patient care outcomes. Because missing, inaccurate information can result in deleterious outcomes, most handovers include a structured tool to ensure vital information is communicated. Current data have focused on the information and communication in handover. However, few studies address the difficulty implementing a new handover system, in particular, optimizing the framework for successful stakeholder engagement. Herein, we report on the introduction of a pilot handover system. Methods: A new system for urology resident handover was implemented at two institutions in Toronto, from July 2015 to April 2016. The primary outcome was handover information inclusion rate (IIR) assessed on a nine-item scale prior to, and at two time-points after introducing the structured handover. Handover items were decided through stakeholder meetings, including: patient name, age, responsible physician, postop- erative day, diagnosis, medical history, active issues, diet, and discharge planning. Incomplete fields were considered negative responses. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Secondary outcomes assessing satisfaction with handover and subjective improvement of handover communication were anonymously collected and graded on five-point Likert scale to rate handover experience. Results: At one institution (A), the new handover system had strong uptake and utilization. However, the other institution (B) failed to adopt the handover system. At institution A, the original handover achieved an IIR of 63% of handover items prior to the introduction of the handover by a chief resident. Handover continued to be used throughout the study period, even as residents joined and left the team. By the end of our study, institution A improved to an IIR of 80% (Table 1). Satisfaction with the document was 4.0/5. Most residents felt that the system had improved (4.2/5). The most common area for improvement was handover length to better highlight active issues for a high turnover service (urology). At institution B, the handover system was introduced by a junior resident and had reverted to a verbal, non-documented system within two days of attempted initiation. The IIR at site B remained stagnant at 42%. Conclusions: Effective handover checklists have been described, but stakeholder buy-in remains a challenge. Handover quality improved with the use of a structured tool, but was subject to its utilization. Further research correlating these findings with patient outcomes is required.

METHODS: A survey was sent to 124 departments of neurology in the United States that are accredited by the American Council of Graduate Medical Education via an online Web tool. We collected data regarding the attendance, objectives, format, educational structure, and perceived changes and trends over time. RESULTS: Seventy-five (60%) surveys were returned: 10% were completed by the department chairperson, 4% by the chief resident, and 54% by another faculty member. NGRs were offered by 99% of the programs surveyed, and 95% of the programs conduct NGRs accredited for Continuing Medical Education. Almost all of the respondents agreed that the education of faculty, house staff, and full-time faculty was very important. Ninety-three percent of the programs hold clinical case presentations, and 60% have patients in attendance for the presentation. Programs reported that the quality, importance, and educational value of NGRs had either not changed or had increased over time (94%, 91%, and 89%, respectively). CONCLUSION: NGRs continue to be an important component of neurology residency training programs. The results of our survey were comparable to those obtained by others studying Medical Grand Rounds.

Assignment of schedules is traditionally done by chief residents or program administration with variable input from the residents involved. INTERVENTION: We introduced an innovative point-based scheduling system to increase transparency in the scheduling process, foster a sense of fairness and equality in scheduling, and increase resident ownership for making judicious scheduling choices. METHODS: We devised a point-based system in which each resident in our 40-member program was allocated an equal number of points. The residents assigned these points to their preferred choices of rotations. Residents were then surveyed anonymously on their perceptions of this new scheduling system and were asked to compare it with their traditional scheduling system. RESULTS: The schedule was successfully implemented, and it allowed residents to express their scheduling preferences using an innovative point-based approach. Residents were generally satisfied with the new system, would recommend it to other programs, and perceived a greater sense of involvement. However, resident satisfaction with the new system was not significantly greater compared with the previous approach to scheduling (P = .20). Chief residents expressed satisfaction with the new scheduling model. CONCLUSIONS: Residents were equally satisfied with the traditional preference-based scheduling approach and the new point-based system. Chief residents' feedback on the new system reflected reduced stress and time commitment in the new point-based system.","1949-8357     Chow, Robert Tao-Ping     Tamhane, Shrikant     Zhang, Manling     Fisher, Lori-Ann     Yoon, Jenni     Sehgal, Sameep     Lumbres, Madel     Han, Ma Ai Thanda     Win, Tiffany     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2015 Sep;7(3):451-3. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00530.1.

We undertook this study to examine the effects on resident operative experience. We retrospectively analyzed chief residents' Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs before (PRE) and after (POST) the 80-hour work restriction. Overall, 22 resident logs were evaluated, six PRE and 16 POST. Four case categories were examined: total major cases, total trauma operative cases, total chief cases, and total teaching assistant cases. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. Comparing the PRE and POST groups demonstrated a trend toward fewer total major cases (1061 vs 964, P = 0.38) and fewer total trauma operative cases (55 vs 47, P = 0.37). Teaching assistant cases increased from 67 to 91 but also failed to reach significance (P = 0.37). However, further comparison between the PRE and POST groups yielded a statistically significant decrease in the number of total chief cases (494 vs 333, P = 0.0092). The significant decrease in the number of total chief cases demonstrates that the work hour restriction most affected the chief year operative experience. Further evaluation of resident participation in nonoperative facets may reveal additional deficiencies of surgical training under work hour restrictions.","Christmas, A Britton     Brintzenhoff, Rita A     Sing, Ronald F     Schmelzer, Thomas M     Bolton, Sandra D     Miles, William S     Thomason, Michael H     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Am Surg. 2009 Nov;75(11):1065-8.

In this study, the advice offered by the expert system was compared to that of physicians-in-training. Five actual patient care situations were presented to the system and to 13 medical students and surgical residents: four MS-III, three PGY-I, three PGY-III, and three PGY-V. The suggestions of each of the 13 trainees, the advice of the expert system, and the actual management were blinded. Five surgeons versed in trauma and otherwise not involved in the project judged whether each of the 15 purported management plans was acceptable and ranked them in order of preference. Only the actual care and the advice from the system were judged acceptable for all five problems. The rankings of the expert system were better than those of any individual trainee. The differences were statistically significant for two of the three chief residents, five of nine residents overall, and all four students.

A. and Piepgras, D. G. and Krishnamurthy, S. and Fessler, R. D.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: The new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirements regarding resident work hours have been implemented since July 2003. Neurological surgery training programs have been especially affected because of the limited number of residency positions and the residents' long duty hours. The perceptions of program directors and residents may provide important insight into the evolution of new guidelines for improvement of resident training. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey of 93 program directors and 617 residents to characterize their perceptions regarding the changes in their training programs related to compliance with the ACGME requirements. The survey was conducted from July through September 2003 using electronic mail. RESULTS: The response rates were 45% and 23% among the program directors and residents, respectively. Most programs offered one (37%) or two (38%) resident training positions per year. Although 92% of programs had implemented the ACGME work hours requirements before or since July 2003, 8% had not yet implemented these guidelines. Sixty-eight percent of program directors indicated employment of ancillary health care professionals to fulfill the ACGME duty hours reform; 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-94%) thought that this practice has not limited the residents' clinical experience. Eleven percent of respondents (18 of 164 respondents) who provided Level I trauma coverage were unable to maintain compliance with the ACGME guidelines. Ninety-three percent (95% CI, 89-96%) of all respondents thought that the work hour reform has had a negative impact on the continuity of patient care. Fifty-five percent (95% CI, 46-63%) of the residents and only 33% (95% CI, 20-50%) of the program directors thought that the ACGME requirements are likely to result in improved American Board of Neurological Surgery written test scores. Twenty-nine percent (95% CI, 22-37%) of the residents and 17% (95% CI, 8-32%) of the program directors thought that resident attendance at national conferences would increase. Similarly, although 46% (95% CI, 37-54%) of residents perceived that these work hour limitations would facilitate residents' research/publication-related activities, only 21% (95% CI, 11-37%) of program directors agreed. Forty-one percent (95% CI, 33-49%) of the residents and 74% (95% CI, 58-86%) of the program directors perceived that the chief residents operate on fewer complex cases since the institution of the ACGME duty hour guidelines. Seventy-five percent of residents think they are less familiar with their patients. Overall, 61% (95% CI, 53-69%) of the residents and 79% (95% CI, 63-89%) of the program directors noted that the ACGME guidelines have had a negative effect on their training programs. CONCLUSION: On the basis of their early experience, the majority of the residents and program directors think that the ACGME duty hour guidelines have had an adverse effect on continuity of patient care and resident training. The effects of these guidelines on neurosurgery programs should be carefully monitored, because more sophisticated solutions may be needed to address house staff fatigue. Strategies to enhance the educational content of the residents' work hours and to preserve continuity of patient care are necessary.","1524-4040     Cohen-Gadol, Aaron A     Piepgras, David G     Krishnamurthy, Satish     Fessler, Richard D     Journal Article     United States     Neurosurgery. 2005 Feb;56(2):398-403; discussion 398-403.

H. and Rosborough, D. and Fernandez, J.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The present era of health care places major emphasis on significantly reducing cost and resource utilization while maintaining quality of care and patient satisfaction. Clinicians are being challenged to achieve this within the framework of a patient subset that is increasing in severity of disease and risk-adjusted mortality. The Brigham and Women's Cardiac Surgical Services Management Group was formed in 1987 to help accomplish these goals. METHODS: The principles we have followed involve protocols and people. The multidisciplinary group includes the chiefs of cardiac surgery and anesthesia, chief residents, physician assistants, perfusionists, intensive care unit nursing personnel, and case managers. Weekly meetings address every aspect of problems arising in the cardiac surgical service; separate weekly morbidity and mortality conferences are held. The Care Coordination Team establishes and monitors clinical pathways and recommends ways of improving all aspects of the service through a process of daily review on an individual patient basis. RESULTS: The volume of cardiac surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital has increased steadily. The length of stay overall has decreased about 15%, and similarly, cost and total charges have also decreased. In addition, patient satisfaction has increased to a level of about 95%. CONCLUSIONS: The goals of cost-containment with improved patient care and outcome are possible through the collaborative efforts of representatives of all the personnel involved in cardiac care, as well as leadership by the surgical faculty.","Cohn, L H     Rosborough, D     Fernandez, J     Journal Article     Netherlands     Ann Thorac Surg. 1997 Dec;64(6 Suppl):S58-60; discussion S80-2.

V.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: In order to understand how current surgical residents feel about their training, a survey focused on perceptions regarding early entry into a subspecialty and the adequacy of training was sent to selected residency programs in general surgery (GS). STUDY DESIGN: A 36-item online anonymous survey was sent to the program directors of 55 GS programs. The national sample consisted of 1,515 PGY 1 to PGY 5 categorical residents. RESULTS: The response rate was 45%. Overall, 80% were planning on pursuing a fellowship. The majority (63%) believed that the Residency Review Committee for Surgery and the American Board of Surgery should consider the shift to early subspecialty training. Almost 70% of respondents preferred a 3-year basic track followed by a 3-year subspecialty track. In response to the survey item, ""Do you think a 5-year GS residency fully prepares you to practice GS?"", 38% of residents overall responded ""no"" or ""unsure."" This figure decreased with each increasing year of residency training, from PGY 1 (53.3%) to PGY 5 (23%). Finally, 71% of residents who answered ""no"" or ""unsure"" to the above question believe there should be a change to a track system. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of fellowship training for 80% of trainees partially reflects that 38% are not confident about their skills with 5 years of training in GS, including 23% of graduating chief residents. Training and certifying groups should update and strengthen the current curriculum for categorical residents in GS and continue their efforts to offer shortened independent or integrated residency training for those who will enter surgical specialties.

B. and Divino, C. M.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: In July 2011, new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty-hour regulations were implemented in surgical residency programs. We examined whether differences in objective measures of surgical training exist at our institution since implementation. DESIGN: Retrospective reviews of the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination performance and surgical case volume were collected for 5 academic years. Data were separated into 2 groups, Period 1: July 2008 through June 2011 and Period 2: July 2011 through June 2013. SETTING: Single-institution study conducted at the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, a tertiary-care academic center. PARTICIPANTS: All general surgery residents, levels postgraduate year 1 through 5, from July 2008 through June 2013. RESULTS: No significant differences in the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination total correct score or overall test percentile were noted between periods for any levels. Intern case volume increased significantly in Period 2 (90 vs 77, p = 0.036). For chief residents graduating in Period 2, there was a significant increase in total major cases (1062 vs 945, p = 0.002) and total chief cases (305 vs 267, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The duty-hour regulations did not negatively affect objective measures of surgical training in our program. Compliance with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty-hour regulations correlated with an increase in case volume. Adaptations made by our institution, such as maximizing daytime duty hours and increasing physician extenders, likely contributed to our findings.","1878-7452     Condren, Audree B     Divino, Celia M     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2015 Sep-Oct;72(5):855-61. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.04.018.

This interest in surgery increased to 63% after the nonmetropolitan clerkship, P < .05. When match numbers were examined, students who completed the nonmetropolitan clerkship were significantly more likely to match to a general surgical residency than students who completed the standard clerkship (17% vs 6%, P < .02). CONCLUSIONS: These data challenge the perception that students should remain at a teaching university for their introductory clerkships.

To attempt to characterize the barriers toward adoption of this technology, we conducted a survey of academic radiologists and radiology trainees. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Institutional Review Board-approved survey was distributed to the Association of University Radiologists members via e-mail. Survey results were collected electronically, tabulated, and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 68 survey responses representing 51 programs were received from program directors, department chairs, chief residents, and program administrators. The most common form of educational activity for resident call preparation was lectures. Faculty supervised ""baby call"" was also widely reported. Actual simulated call environments were quite rare with only three programs reporting this type of educational activity. Barriers to the use of simulation include lack of faculty time, lack of faculty expertise, and lack of perceived need. CONCLUSIONS: High-fidelity simulation can be used to mimic the high-stress, high-stakes independent call environment that the typical radiology resident encounters during the second year of training, and can provide objective data for program directors to assess the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education milestones. We predict that this technology will begin to supplement traditional diagnostic radiology teaching methods and to improve patient care and safety in the next decade.","1878-4046     Cook, Tessa S     Hernandez, Jessica     Scanlon, Mary     Langlotz, Curtis     Li, Chun-Der L     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Acad Radiol. 2016 Jul;23(7):870-6. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2016.03.008.

G. and Willis, R. and Stewart, R. M. and Dent, D. L.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Performance on the American Board of Surgery (ABS) Qualifying Exam (QE) correlates well with chief resident American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam (ABSITE) scores. Yearly ABSITE performance is a useful gauge of resident fund of knowledge and can identify residents at risk of QE failure. We hypothesize that a brief practice exam administered 1-3 times each academic year can identify residents at risk of poor ABSITE performance and also identify early in the chief resident year those at risk for poor QE performance. METHODS: In 2005 we began administering 2-3 times/year an approximately 50 question exam consisting of questions authored by residents and edited by faculty based on the ABSITE exam keywords. The exam was considered mandatory and educational time was allotted. Data were analyzed by determining an individual's score deviation from the mean within PGY class. The standard deviation was then compared to the corresponding years ABSITE percentile and in the final year, QE performance using the Spearman rank correlation test. RESULTS: A total of 710 individual practice exams were offered and 462 (65.1%) were completed in 9 sessions. Two hundred sixty-three residents completed both a practice examination and ABSITE in the year preceding the administration of the ABSITE. Twenty-six chief residents completed a practice examination in the year immediately preceding the ABS QE. Correlations between practice exam scores and ABSITE score percentile were statistically significant (p= 0.01-0.05) for each year the test was administered. The correlation between the practice exam score for chief residents preceding the QE and first attempt QE score was also significant (r =0.416, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A resident's performance on a brief practice exam administered throughout the year is significantly correlated with both ABSITE performance and ABS QE performance. Such a test can be a useful adjunct for identifying residents at risk for poor ABSITE performance as well as identify prior to return of ABSITE scores those residents at risk for poor ABS QE performance.","1878-7452     Corneille, Michael G     Willis, Ross     Stewart, Ronald M     Dent, Daniel L     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2011 May-Jun;68(3):246-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2010.12.009.

R. and Wise, P. E. and Delman, K. A. and Potts, J. R. and Awad, M. M. and Eberlein, T. J. and Klingensmith, M. E.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The Flexibility in Surgical Training (FIST) consortium project was designed to evaluate the feasibility and resident outcomes of optional subspecialty-focused training within general surgery residency training. STUDY DESIGN: After approval by the American Board of Surgery, R4 and R5 residents were permitted to customize up to 12 of the final 24 months of residency for early tracking into 1 of 9 subspecialty tracks. A prospective IRB-approved study was designed across 7 institutions to evaluate the impact of this option on operative experience, in-service exam (American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination [ABSITE]) and ACGME milestone performance, and resident and program director (PD) perceptions. The FIST residents were compared with chief residents before FIST initiation (controls) as well as residents during the study period who did not participate in FIST (no specialization track, NonS). RESULTS: From 2013 to 2017, 122 of 214 chief residents (57%) completed a FIST subspecialty track. There were no differences in median ABSITE scores between FIST, NonS residents, and controls. The ACGME milestones at the end of the R5 year favored the FIST residents in 13 of 16 milestones compared with NonS. Case logs demonstrated an increase in track-specific cases compared with NonS residents. Resident and PD surveys reported a generally favorable experience with FIST. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, FIST is a feasible option in participating institutions. All FIST residents, regardless of track, met requirements for ABS Board eligibility, despite modifications to rotations and case experience. Future studies will assess the impact of FIST on ABS exam results and fellowship success.","1879-1190     Cullinan, Darren R     Wise, Paul E     Delman, Keith A     Potts, John R     Awad, Michael M     Eberlein, Timothy J     Klingensmith, Mary E     T32 CA009621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States     UL1 TR000448/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     United States     J Am Coll Surg. 2018 Apr;226(4):425-431. doi: 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2017.12.024.

"",Rheumatology education in US pediatric residency programs: Results of a comprehensive program director survey,2012,1,1,Pediatric Rheumatology,,10,,"","Curran, M. L. and Husain, Y.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L70982622,English,,,"Purpose: Rheumatology is one of the smallest subspecialties in the field of pediatrics. Due to the deficiency of pediatric rheumatologists in the U. S., there is a shortage of educators. Previous research showed that 40% of pediatric residency programs have no pediatric rheumatologist on faculty. Although previous studies described the availability of rheumatology training in pediatric residency programs, little is known about the educational content or methods. To develop useful educational curricula for residency program use, rheumatology educators need to understand how pediatric residents are currently taught about rheumatology as well as residency programs' perceived educational needs and barriers. Methods: In the summer of 2010, all pediatric residency program directors in the U.S. and U.S. territories were sent email and paper surveys. Contact information was collected using databases from the American College of Graduate Medical Education and the American Medical Association. Email surveys were sent twice via Survey Monkey three weeks apart. One paper survey and a reminder postcard were sent via U.S. mail. Results: 115 of 197 (58.4%) program directors have responded to date. 68% of programs were university based, 26% community based and 5% were described as other. 65% said that their institution employed pediatric rheumatologists, 34% had no rheumatologist and 1% were unsure. 69% of responding programs lack a required rheumatology rotation. 29% have required rotations supervised by rheumatologists: 12% include both inpatient and outpatient experience, 8% only inpatient and 9% only outpatient. 1% of programs have a required rotation not supervised by a rheumatologist. Educational goals and objectives are not provided to residents in 26% of programs. Of 91 responding programs, rheumatology material is taught by general pediatricians in 73%, orthopedists in 56%, faculty rheumatologists in 53%, visiting pediatric rheumatologists in 23%, chief residents in 23% and senior residents in 15%. Rheumatology is taught via inpatient rounds in 78/87 programs (90%), lectures with slides in 83/88 (94%), informal lecture in 54/77 (70%), demonstration of musculoskeletal exam in 78/87 (90%), video in 6/64 (9%), case based discussion in 62/76 (82%), online coursework in 4/63 (6%), and by board question review in 77/83 (93%). More program directors indicated that residents like live musculoskeletal exam demonstration (95%) compared to video demonstration (59%). Interactive case based lectures and Jeopardy games were perceived to be well-liked at 98% and 90%. Many programs would spend more time teaching rheumatology if a curriculum was provided. Teaching by general pediatricians, chief residents and senior residents would increase. 55% agreed that having insufficient faculty is a barrier to rheumatology education. 42% agreed that poor access to teaching resources is a barrier. Conclusion: Our survey results provide a detailed picture of how rheumatology is taught in pediatric residency and how teaching can be improved. This information is a foundation for the development of teaching materials that will be targeted for residency programs with little rheumatologist contact.","L70982622     2013-02-08 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

J. and Maldonado, L. A. and Gereige, R. S.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: To investigate pediatric chief residents' responsibilities and determine how chief residents and program directors view the scope of the chief resident's role. SURVEY: We distributed a 20-item survey to program directors and chief residents at all US pediatric residency programs. Questions pertained to activities performed and the level of importance of administrative, clinical, and educational activities. The survey also investigated motivating factors to become chief resident, future career plans, and level of job satisfaction. RESULTS: We received responses from 127 program directors and 101 chief residents. Of the chief residents, 98% (99/101) felt administrative tasks were very/somewhat important, followed by education, service, and research. Significantly more program directors than chief residents felt chiefs' overall workload was well balanced. Program directors gave higher ratings than chief residents on chief's ability to develop clinical skills (79% [95/121] versus 61% [61/100]) and manage stress and burnout (86% [104/121] versus 72% [72/100]). Future career plans for chief residents in decreasing order included fellowship, outpatient practice, academic practice, and working as a hospitalist. The most significant problems reported by the chief residents were lack of administrative support and lack of time spent in educational/clinical activities. CONCLUSIONS: The chief resident role is primarily administrative, but program directors and chiefs feel teaching and clinical responsibilities also are important. Although the 2 groups agreed in many areas, program directors underestimated the administrative demands placed on the chief residents, and our findings suggest the chief resident role may be more fulfilling if the balance was shifted somewhat toward teaching and clinical responsibilities.","1949-8357     Dabrow, Sharon M     Harris, Elizabeth J     Maldonado, Luis A     Gereige, Rani S     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2011 Mar;3(1):17-20. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-10-00039.1.

Research on the topic is minimal and has never been performed within Canadian emergency medicine training programs. The objective was to perform the first national survey of Canadian FRCP (Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians) EM (emergency medicine) residents, pediatric EM residents, and their respective program directors to determine if outcome feedback is obtained for patients treated in the emergency department. The study simultaneously investigated and compared the perceived educational value of outcome feedback by residents and program directors. Methods: We distributed surveys to all Canadian FRCP and pediatric EM programs. Using a modified Dillman method, program directors received an online survey while residents received a paper version distributed by their chief resident during a mandatory academic session. The piloted surveys contained 20 and 19 questions, respectively, regarding outcome feedback systems, educational values, and demographics. P values were calculated using Student t-test and Fisher exact test. Results: Completed surveys were collected from 188 of 237 eligible residents (79.3%) and 21 of 24 program directors (87.5%) for an overall response rate of 80.0%. Mandatory patient follow-up was not present in any EM training program for admitted or discharged patients. Followup was performed electively by 91.4% of residents for patients admitted to the hospital and by 49.1% of residents for patients discharged home. A majority of residents (77.5%) believed that some type of patient follow-up should be mandatory compared to 42.8% of program directors (p = 0.005). The perceived educational value of outcome feedback was 5.8/7 for residents and 5.1/7 for program directors (difference 0.70; p = 0.003) based on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not important; 7 = very important). Conclusion: While Canadian EM training programs do not mandate follow-up, it is performed electively by the majority of residents surveyed. Residents place a significantly greater educational value on outcome feedback than their program directors and believe that follow-up should be a mandatory component of Canadian EM residencies.","L71129135     2013-08-12 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Conflicting evidence exists regarding the influence of duty-hour restrictions upon resident operative experience. METHODS: Resident self-reported operative experience submitted to the Residency Review Committee (RRC) for Surgery was tabulated. To control for a possible overall decrease in surgical procedures, for example, a decrease in referrals to the institution, the departmental database of surgical billings that is maintained independently from resident operative experience data also was reviewed. RESULTS: An overall decrease of nearly 20% occurred in resident operative volume after promulgation of duty-hour restrictions. All residents met minimum RRC operative experience requirements. Over the same period, no decrease was found in the number surgical procedures performed by the department. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that restriction of resident duty hours is associated with a significant decrease in operative experience.","Damadi, Amir     Davis, Alan T     Saxe, Andrew     Apelgren, Keith     Comparative Study     Evaluation Studies     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2007 Sep-Oct;64(5):256-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2007.07.008.

N.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: The processes used by institutions to manage and coordinate multiple pharmacy residency programs were evaluated. METHODS: An 18-question survey was developed. The survey was distributed via e-mail to all University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) member institutions. The survey request was e-mailed to the pharmacy director of each hospital. Respondents submitted their information in an unblinded process. The survey was completed between May 31, 2011, and June 29, 2011. Respondents who indicated that their institution did not have four or more residency programs did not complete the remaining survey questions. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey responses. RESULTS: Of the 236 surveys distributed, 43 (18%) were completed. Of these, 28 had at least four unique residency programs. The majority of specific duties related to residencies (i.e., budgeting, project development, compliance with residency standards, scheduling of rotations and operations, and residency showcase preparation) were primarily the responsibility of the residency program director (RPD), residency activities coordinator, chief resident, or department chair or director. All of the programs surveyed had a residency program advisory committee (RAC). A majority of the programs (96%) had only one advisory committee overseeing both their postgraduate year 1 and postgraduate year 2 programs. The majority of respondents (60%) reported utilizing part-time administrative support for the residency programs; the remaining 40% reported no administrative support. CONCLUSION: UHC organizations with multiple pharmacy residency programs placed the majority of the responsibility for programs on the RPD, residency activities coordinator (where that model was used), and the pharmacy department chair. All programs utilized an RAC to govern the residency programs at their sites.","1535-2900     Daniels, Charles E     Pettit, Natasha N     Journal Article     United States     Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2013 Mar 1;70(5):431-4. doi: 10.2146/ajhp120475.

28344692,A landscape analysis of leadership training in postgraduate medical education training programs at the University of Ottawa,2016,1,1,Can Med Educ J,,7,2,e32-e50,"Danilewitz, M. and McLean, L.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition of the importance of physician leadership in healthcare. At the same time, becoming an effective leader requires significant training. While educational opportunities for practicing physicians exist to develop their leadership skills, there is a paucity of leadership opportunities for post graduate trainees. In response to this gap, both the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada have recommended that leadership training be considered a focus in Post Graduate Medical Education (PGME). However, post-graduate leadership curricula and opportunities in PGME training programs in Canada are not well described. The goal of this study was to determine the motivation for PGME leadership training, the opportunities available, and educational barriers experienced by PGME programs at the University of Ottawa. METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to all 70 PGME Program Directors (PDs) at the University of Ottawa. Two PDs were selected, based on strong leadership programs, for individual interviews. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 55.7%. Seventy-seven percent of responding PDs reported resident participation in leadership training as being ""important,"" while only 37.8% of programs incorporated assessment of resident leadership knowledge and/or skills into their PGME program. Similarly, only 29.7% of responding residency programs offered chief resident leadership training. CONCLUSIONS: While there is strong recognition of the importance of training future physician leaders, the nature and design of PGME leadership training is highly variable. These data can be used to potentially inform future PGME leadership training curricula.","Danilewitz, Marlon     McLean, Laurie     Journal Article     Canada     Can Med Educ J. 2016 Oct 18;7(2):e32-e50. eCollection 2016 Oct.

L. and Ewing, J. A. and Lokey, J. S.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of a thyroid nodule is a common referral seen by surgeons and frequently requires ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (US-guided FNA). While surgical residents may have sufficient exposure to thyroid surgery, many lack exposure to office-based procedures, such as US-guided FNA. General surgery residents should be provided with knowledge and practical skills in the application of diagnostic and interventional neck ultrasound to manage the common workup of a thyroid nodule. METHODS: This study sought to instruct and measure surgical residents' performance in thyroid US-guided FNA and evaluate their views regarding instituting such a formal curriculum. Twelve (n = 12) senior residents completed a written pretest and questionnaire, then watched an instructional video and practiced a simulated thyroid US-guided FNA on our created model. Then residents were evaluated while performing actual thyroid US-guided FNAs on patients in our clinic. Residents then completed the same written exam and questionnaire for objective measure. RESULTS: Eight of the chief residents (62%) felt ""not comfortable"" with the procedure on the pre-course survey; this was reduced to 0% on the post-course survey. Moderate comfort level increased from 15% to 50% and extreme comfort increased from 0% to 8%. From the 11 residents who completed the pre- and post-test exam, 82% (n = 9) significantly improved their score through the curriculum (pre-test: 40.9 vs. post-test: 61.8; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: With focused instruction, residents are able to learn ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy with improvement in subjective confidence level and objective measures. Resident feedback was positive and emphasized the importance of such training in surgical residency curriculum.","1878-7452     Davis, James R     Hale, Allyson L     Ewing, Joseph A     Lokey, Jonathan S     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2018 May - Jun;75(3):594-600. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.09.031.

A.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Resident clinics are thought to catalyze educational milestone achievement through opportunities for progressively autonomous surgical care, but studies are lacking for general plastic surgery resident clinics (PSRCs). We demonstrate the achievement of increased surgical autonomy and continuity of care in a PSRC. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients seen in a PSRC from October 1, 2010, to October 1, 2015, was conducted. Our PSRC is supervised by faculty plastic surgery attendings, though primarily run by chief residents in an accredited independent plastic surgery training program. Surgical autonomy was scored on a 5-point scale based on dictated operative reports. Graduated chief residents were additionally surveyed by anonymous online survey. RESULTS: Thousand one hundred forty-four patients were seen in 3,390 clinic visits. Six hundred fifty-three operations were performed by 23 total residents, including 10 graduating chiefs. Senior resident autonomy averaged 3.5/5 (SD = 1.5), 3.6/5 (SD = 1.5), to 3.8/5 (SD = 1.3) in postgraduate years 6, 7, and 8, respectively. A linear mixed model analysis demonstrated that training level had a significant impact on operative autonomy when comparing postgraduate years 6 and 8 (P = 0.026). Graduated residents' survey responses (N = 10; 100% response rate) regarded PSRC as valuable for surgical experience (4.1/5), operative autonomy (4.4/5), medical knowledge development (4.7/5), and the practice of Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education core competencies (4.3/5). Preoperative or postoperative continuity of care was maintained in 93.5% of cases.

J. and Stabile, B. E. and Putnam, B. A.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: To determine whether the 80-hour resident workweek adversely affects patient outcomes or resident education. METHODS: To assess patient outcomes, the authors reviewed trauma patient morbidity and mortality at the second busiest level I trauma center in Los Angeles County before (July 1998-June 2003, Period 1) and after (July 2003-June 2005, Period 2) implementation of the duty hour limitation via a retrospective review of a prospective database. All patients were operated and managed by residents under faculty supervision. Patient characteristics included the injury severity score (ISS), mechanism of injury, complications, and death. To assess resident education, the authors compared ABSITE percentile scores, first-time pass rates on the American Board of Surgery Qualifying and Certifying Examinations, and total and chief resident operative case volumes. In addition, they estimated institutional costs incurred to comply with the new duty hour rules. RESULTS: Patient outcomes. Over the entire 7-year study period, 11,518 trauma patients were transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Compared with Period 1, Period 2 experienced an increase in average yearly patient volume from 1510 to 1981 (p 0.01). The average ISS also increased, from 7.9 to 9.6 (p < 0.0001), as did the proportion of penetrating trauma from 14.8% to 17.6% (p < 0.0001). Morbidity and mortality rates remained unchanged. Resident education. Mean ABSITE scores and first-time Qualifying and Certifying Exam pass rates were unchanged. Mean resident total major case volumes increased significantly in Period 2 from 831 to 1156 (p < 0.0001), whereas chief resident year case volumes were unchanged. The estimated cost incurred by this institution to conform to the new work hour standards was approximately 359,000 dollars per year. CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns that the 80-hour workweek might threaten patient care and resident education, the morbidity and mortality rates at a busy level I trauma center remained unchanged. The quality of surgical resident education, as measured by operative volumes, ABSITE scores, and written and oral board examination pass rates were likewise unchanged. The reorganization of the authors' general surgery residency program to comply with the duty hour restrictions was achieved within reasonable cost.","de Virgilio, Christian     Yaghoubian, Arezou     Lewis, Roger J     Stabile, Bruce E     Putnam, Brant A     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2006 Nov-Dec;63(6):435-9; discussion 440. doi: 10.1016/j.cursur.2006.03.006.

However, the responsibilities, preparation, and selection for this role vary widely. At the University of Missouri (MU), we developed a unique leadership curriculum to enhance training for this role that includes attendance at leadership conferences, acquisition of specific skills such as time management and communication, defined responsibilities, and administrative time to complete duties. A survey of former MU chief residents found that aspects of the position such as leadership training and increased exposure to faculty were most valued while schedule tasks were seen as least desirable. Former chief residents were more likely to teach medical students or residents in their current practice compared to those who had not been a chief resident.","1938-3800     Deane, Kristen     Ringdahl, Erika     Journal Article     United States     Fam Med. 2012 Feb;44(2):117-20.

METHODS: A 1-page self-administered questionnaire was mailed to residency training directors and chief residents at 104 dermatology and 103 internal medicine residency programs from the same or affiliated medical centers. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by respondents from 70 (68%) of 103 internal medicine programs and 86 (83%) of 104 dermatology programs. Most respondents (91% internal medicine and 70% dermatology) strongly agreed or agreed that evidence-based internal medicine/dermatology is valuable and should be included in residency training (93% internal medicine and 70% dermatology). Respondents from internal medicine programs agreed more strongly with both statements than respondents from dermatology programs (P =.001). Dedicated evidence-based curricula were in place at significantly more internal medicine programs (50 [71%] of 70) than dermatology programs (20 [23%] of 86) (P<.001). Curricula at internal medicine programs offered significantly more evidence-based medicine training sessions (24 vs 6; P<.001) and biostatistics sessions (10 vs 2.3; P =.03), and internal medicine programs more frequently evaluated the curricula using clinical question applications (56% vs 30%; P =.04).

The purpose of this study is to define the range of practice in treating children with uncomplicated loss of consciousness by determining: (1) the frequency of ""routine"" hospitalization for observation and (2) those criteria which, when present, result in hospitalization. A total of 957 pediatricians representing five groups of physicians responded to a nationwide questionnaire survey to determine current treatment practices for uncomplicated loss of consciousness.

Academic child neurologists and child neurologists in private practice hospitalize these patients least frequently, 29% and 31%, respectively (P less than 0.05). Of pediatricians in private practice, 38% admit all children with loss of consciousness. Pediatricians from all groups who do not routinely hospitalize all children with uncomplicated loss of consciousness showed similarity in the criteria they use for admission.

Factors that influenced his early career are described, with extensive quotes from a document that Geschwind wrote in 1982, supplemented by interviews with his childhood friends, colleagues from his early career, and his daughter. He entered Harvard College as a math major, but became interested in psychology when he served in the Army infantry in World War II and observed soldiers who acted irrationally in combat. Returning to undergraduate studies, he was taught that knowledge of the brain would shed little light on behavior. His interest in behavioral neurology began with his medical student courses in physiology and neuroanatomy, where he first learned about epilepsy and aphasia. He then trained for 2 years at Queen Square, where his research focused on periodic paralysis, but was greatly influenced by the writings of Hughlings Jackson and Charles Bastian and the teachings of Sir Charles Symonds. Returning to Boston, Geschwind became Dr. Denny-Brown's Chief Resident at the Neurologic Unit of Boston City Hospital. Another unrecognized source of Norman Geschwind's intellectual legacy is the unpublished course he taught on The Neurology of Behavior at Harvard Medical School in the 1970s and 1980s. These lectures were an opportunity for Geschwind to formulate, share, and refine his ideas on behavioral neurology to an eclectic mixture of Boston academics, from linguists, philosophers, and anthropologists to physiologists and psychiatrists. From tape recordings of the Spring 1974 course, 10 lectures were transcribed. One of these slightly edited lectures, ""Personality Changes in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy,"" is reproduced in this issue of Epilepsy & Behavior.","1525-5069     Devinsky, Orrin     Biography     Historical Article     Journal Article     United States     Epilepsy Behav. 2009 Aug;15(4):413-6. doi: 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.04.029.

C. and Tarnavsky, T. and Khan, I. and Panych, L. P.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Although significant attention has been paid to the number of hours worked by residents, little consideration has been given to how the hours are assigned. This project describes an alternative to having Chief Residents manually create on-call schedules. In order to enhance objectivity and transparency, reduce perceived inequities in the process, and reduce inter-resident conflict, Harvard South Shore Psychiatry Residency Training Program experimented with a computer-generated on-call schedule. METHOD: A locally written MATLAB script generated an on-call schedule for academic year (AY) 2012-2013. Measurements to assess the manual scheduling method (from AY 2011-2012) and the computer-generated method included the balance in the total number of hours assigned to individual residents; the number of call switches over two six-month periods; and survey of the residents' perception of fairness of the two scheduling methods and preferences. RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of the AY 2011-2012 Chief Resident-generated call schedule found a range of differences of up to 25.8% between total hours assigned to individual residents in a given year. In the AY 2012-2013 computer-generated schedule, the differences in total hours assigned were reduced to a maximum of 6.1%. There were 63% fewer call switches resulting from the computer-generated as compared to the Chief Resident-generated method. Resident survey response rate was 76%. Seventy-seven percent of resident respondents (N = 22) perceived the computer-generated method to be fairer, and 90.9% of residents preferred having a summary table of hours of call per resident. Residents perceived the computer-generated method as resulting in less inter-resident conflict. CONCLUSION: Methods for assigning duty hour schedules that are transparent, equitable, and require less Chief involvement may result in perceptions of greater fairness and less inter-resident conflict.","1545-7230     Dickey, Chandlee C     Tarnavsky, Tetanya     Khan, Ilea     Panych, Lawrence P     Journal Article     United States     Acad Psychiatry. 2014 Apr;38(2):213-6. doi: 10.1007/s40596-014-0060-8.

Further, sleep problems unrelated to psychiatric pathology often serve as a common chief complaint at many psychiatric clinic visits. Therefore it is essential that psychiatry residents be trained in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of sleep disorders. Methods: In 2013, a 29-item peer reviewed sleep medicine education survey was created and distributed to 39 psychiatry chief residents at the 2013 Annual Chief Residents Tarrytown Meeting. The survey included questions about program size, sleep fellowship afiliation, didactics, sleep lab exposure, availability of faculty with board certiication in sleep medicine, comfort in screening patients for common sleep complaints, ability to participate in sleep research, and the means by which certain sleep topics are taught. This survey provided an overall assessment of current sleep medicine education in psychiatry training programs across the U.S. Results: Of the 39 psychiatry residency programs surveyed, 19 had a dedicated sleep medicine clinic and 6 offered a sleep fellowship. The survey demonstrated that 89% of the programs offered sleep medicine didactics, 38% offered training in cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, 34% offered sleep medicine rotations, 38% had programs with faculty board certiied in sleep medicine, and 10% offered polysomnography lab exposure. At the end of their third year of residency, 72% of residents were comfortable screening for obstructive sleep apnea, 53% of residents were comfortable screening for restless legs syndrome, and 47% were comfortable screening for other sleep disorders. Conclusion: While most programs offer sleep medicine didactics, only a minority offer sleep medicine rotations, polysomnography lab exposure, access to board certiied sleep medicine faculty, and training in CBT for insomnia. There is signiicant room for improvement in educating residents about screening for sleep disorders. Increasing quality of sleep medicine education will improve patient care and may promote interest in sleep medicine fellowships.","L71510205     2014-07-01 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

In 2012, the Council of Residency Directors (CORD) recommended that EM residency program Twitter accounts be managed by faculty and not trainees, yet since this time, little has been published regarding the actual practice patterns of EM residency programs using Twitter. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to provide descriptive analysis regarding current practice patterns among EM residency programs with Twitter accounts. It was hypothesized that practice patterns differed from prior CORD recommendations. Methods: In this IRB-approved mixed-methods cross-sectional study, a six question anonymous survey was distributed via spaced emails using the online tool SurveyMonkey © to EM residency program directors nationwide. Additionally, a Twitter-based search was conducted and the public profiles for EM residency program Twitter accounts were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis were performed on the data set. Results: Of the 168 ACGME-accredited EM residency programs surveyed, 88 programs responded (52% response rate), with 59% of respondents reporting an affiliated EM residency program Twitter account. Residents more commonly served as content managers for their programs Twitter accounts than faculty (43% vs 37%) with chief residents accounting for 28% of all content managers. Most programs (89%) do not publicly disclose the identity or positions of their content managers. A wide variety of applications for Twitter are currently in practice, with EM residency programs most commonly using Twitter for educational and promotional purposes. There is significant variability in the number of followers between EM residency programs' Twitter accounts. Conclusions: Applications and usage among EM residency programs are varied, but largely inconsistent with prior CORD recommendations.","L623465865     2018-08-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

P. and Cagle, K. M.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: There has been a trend toward subspecialization among general surgery graduates, and many subspecialists are reticent to participate in trauma care. This has resulted in a gap in the provision of emergency surgical care. The Acute Care Surgery (ACS) fellowship, incorporating trauma, critical care, and emergency general surgery, was developed to address this need. One of the most important aspects in establishing these ACS fellowships is that they do not detract from the existing general surgery residents' experience. METHODS: The operative case logs for residents and fellows were compared for the number of resident cases during the 3 years before the ACS fellowship and during the 3 years after the fellowship was established. Surveys were distributed to the general surgery residents addressing the impact of the fellows from the resident's perspective at the end of the 2011 to 2012 academic year. RESULTS: There was no significant change in the number of total cases; total chief resident cases; and trauma, thoracic, or vascular procedures done per graduate. A decrease in the number of liver cases performed by the residents was noted but includes the increase in resident complement as well as the fellowship. ACS fellow cases increased from 172 cases in the first year to 221 cases in the second year and 295 in the third year. The survey showed that the residents had a very positive response to having the fellow as a teacher and did not feel like their operative experience was compromised with the addition of the ACS fellowship. CONCLUSION: The ACS fellow did not compromise general surgery resident experience and was regarded as an asset to the resident's education. An ACS fellowship can be beneficial to residents and fellows.

To adapt to these changes, graduate medical education can adopt a chief resident-led clinical curriculum. Chief residents are ideal clinical instructors, as they are recent graduates who have excelled in their residency programs. To effectively use the limited time available for education, chief residents can implement active learning techniques. We present a chief resident-led, small-group, problem-based curriculum for teaching first-year internal medicine residents, and provide preliminary data supporting the efficacy of this approach. METHODS: The seminar consisted of 11 4-week modules. Week 1 was a team-based crossword competition. Weeks 2-4 were small-group, problem-based clinical reasoning sessions taught by chief residents. The program was evaluated via pre- and post-module multiple-choice tests. Resident satisfaction data were collected via self-reported, anonymous surveys. RESULTS: Preliminary results revealed a statistically significant increase from pre-test to post-test score for 9 of the 11 modules. The chest pain, fever, abdominal pain, shock, syncope, jaundice, dizziness, anemia, and acute kidney injury modules achieved statistical significance. Additionally, resident satisfaction surveys show that this teaching approach was an enjoyable experience for our residents. DISCUSSION: Our chief seminar is an evidence-based, clinical reasoning approach for graduate medical education that uses active learning techniques. This is an effective and enjoyable method for educating internal medicine residents. Because of its reproducibility, it can be applied throughout residency education.","Dittus, Christopher     Grover, Vanya     Panagopoulos, Georgia     Jhaveri, Kenar     Journal Article     England     F1000Res. 2014 Sep 8;3:213. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.5221.1. eCollection 2014.

Instruction in teaching skills may assist radiology residents in becoming more effective teachers and increase their overall satisfaction with teaching. The purposes of this study were to survey radiology residents' teaching experiences during residency and to assess perceived benefits following participation in a teaching skills development course. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study participants were radiology residents with membership in the American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology or the Siemens AUR Radiology Resident Academic Development Program who participated in a 1.5-hour workshop on teaching skills development at the 2010 Association of University Radiologists meeting. Participants completed a self-administered, precourse questionnaire that addressed their current teaching strategies, as well as the prevalence and structure of teaching skills training opportunities at their institutions. A second postcourse questionnaire enabled residents to evaluate the seminar and assessed new knowledge and skill acquisition. RESULTS: Seventy-eight residents completed the precourse and postcourse questionnaires. The vast majority of respondents indicated that they taught medical students (72 of 78 [92.3%]). Approximately 20% of residency programs (17 of 78) provided residents with formal didactic programs on teaching skills. Fewer than half (46.8%) of the resident respondents indicated that they received feedback on their teaching from attending physicians (36 of 77), and only 18% (13 of 78) routinely gave feedback to their own learners. All of the course participants agreed or strongly agreed that this workshop was helpful to them as teachers. CONCLUSIONS: Few residency programs had instituted resident teacher training curricula. A resident teacher training workshop was perceived as beneficial by the residents, and they reported improvement in their teaching skills.","1878-4046     Donovan, Andrea     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Acad Radiol. 2011 Apr;18(4):518-24. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2010.10.021.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the perceived value and impact of an experiential leadership training program for pediatric chief residents on the chief residents and on their programs and institutions. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective study. Surveys were sent to chief residents who completed the Chief Resident Training Program (CRTP) between 1988 and 2003 and to their program directors and department chairs asking about the value of the program, its impact on leadership capabilities, as well as the effect of chief resident training on programs and institutions. RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of the chief residents and 94% of program directors and department chairs reported that the CRTP was ""very"" or ""somewhat"" relevant, and 92% of the chief residents indicated CRTP had a positive impact on their year as chief resident; and 75% responded it had a positive impact beyond residency. Areas of greatest positive impact included awareness of personality characteristics, ability to manage conflict, giving and receiving feedback, and relationships with others. Fifty-six percent of chief residents reported having held a formal leadership position since chief residency, yet only 28% reported having received additional leadership training.

B. and Gow, K. W.",,eng,,,"IMPORTANCE: The chief resident (CR) year is a pivotal experience in surgical training. Changes in case volume and diversity may impact the educational quality of this important year. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in operative experience for general surgery CRs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Review of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs from 1989-1990 through 2011-2012 divided into 5 periods. Graduates in period 3 were the last to train with unrestricted work hours; those in period 4 were part of a transition period and trained under both systems; and those in period 5 trained fully under the 80-hour work week. Diversity of cases was assessed based on Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education defined categories. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total cases and defined categories were evaluated for changes over time. RESULTS: The average total CR case numbers have fallen (271 in period 1 vs 242 in period 5, P < .001). Total CR cases dropped to their lowest following implementation of the 80-hour work week (236 cases), but rebounded in period 5. The percentage of residents' 5-year operative experience performed as CRs has decreased (30% in period 1 vs 25.6% in period 5, P < .001). Regarding case mix: thoracic, trauma, and vascular cases declined steadily, while alimentary and intra-abdominal operations increased. Recent graduates averaged 80 alimentary and 78 intra-abdominal procedures during their CR years. Compared with period 1, in which these 2 categories represented 47.1% of CR experience, in period 5, they represented 65.2% (P < .001). Endocrine experience has been relatively unchanged. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Total CR cases declined especially acutely following implementation of the 80-hour work week but have since rebounded. Chief resident cases contribute less to overall experience, although this proportion stabilized before the 80-hour work week. Case mix has narrowed, with significant increases in alimentary and intra-abdominal cases. Broad-based general surgery training may be jeopardized by reduced case diversity. Chief resident cases are crucial in surgical training and educators should consider these findings as surgical training evolves.","2168-6262     Drake, Frederick Thurston     Horvath, Karen D     Goldin, Adam B     Gow, Kenneth W     T32 DK070555/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     United States     JAMA Surg. 2013 Sep;148(9):841-7. doi: 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.2919.

Additionally, the study sought to explore aspects of pediatric training in sexual abuse and clinical practice issues surrounding the routine genital examination. METHOD: A 38-item questionnaire was mailed to pediatric chief residents at all of the officially listed pediatric residency-training programs in the continental US. Comparisons were made between this study and the responses to two previous surveys, which asked a more heterogeneous group of physicians to label one of the photographs used in the study. The second photograph was added because of its improved clarity of each anatomic structure when compared to the first photograph used in the previous studies. The study also asked about clinical practice issues surrounding the prepubertal genital examination. RESULTS: An overall response rate of 73% was achieved and analysis was done on 139 respondents. One-half of chief residents thought that their training during residency on sexual abuse was inadequate for practice. Sixty-four percent of chief residents correctly labeled the hymen on the photograph used in the previous studies, which was not significantly different from the 62% and 59% of physicians who correctly labeled the hymen in the previous surveys. In the second photograph, which more clearly displayed the various anatomic structures, 71% correctly labeled the hymen. CONCLUSION: Pediatric chief residents reported variable amounts of training on issues pertaining to child sexual abuse during residency, think that this time was inadequate, and, while doing slightly better than a more diverse group of previously studied physicians, did not achieve 100% accuracy in identifying basic genital structures correctly on two different photographs.","Dubow, Scott R     Giardino, Angelo P     Christian, Cindy W     Johnson, Charles F     Journal Article     England     Child Abuse Negl. 2005 Feb;29(2):195-205. doi: 10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.03.017.

A. and Mattos, M. A. and Bouwman, D. L.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Few data are available describing the benefits of initiating fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) training during medical school. We hypothesized that an intense 1-month surgical skills elective that included FLS task training for fourth-year medical students (MS4s) would result in performance levels indistinguishable from graduating chief residents (PGY5) who had received clinical skill training and access to self-guided FLS curriculum. METHODS: From July 2007 through June 2011, 114 MS4s participated in a 1-month advanced surgical skills elective. The curriculum for the elective included cadaver dissections, patient management presentations, and surgical skill training (open surgical skills and basic laparoscopic skills modules performed on FLS trainers and virtual reality laparoscopic simulators). From June 2009 through June 2011, 21 PGY5s graduated who had never received formalized FLS skills training. These residents were tested on FLS by a certified proctor and the results recorded. The performance outcome measure was task completion time. Unpaired Student's t-test was used to compare the performance measures for each group. RESULTS: All PGY5s achieved FLS certification on their first attempt and completed enough cases for graduation. The MS4 group showed significantly better performance than the PGY5 group in the peg transfer and circle cut (P < 0.05). No difference was seen in the knot tying tasks between the two groups (P > 0.05) CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating FLS training into a 1 month-long medical school surgery elective enabled MS4s to achieve FLS performance similar to, or better than, the performance achieved by PGY5 surgery residents. We support the integration of FLS skills task training as a standard part of the skills training curriculum for medical students.","1095-8673     Edelman, David A     Mattos, Mark A     Bouwman, David L     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Res. 2012 Oct;177(2):207-10. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2012.05.015.

Traditionally, psychologists have been administrators within academic departments of psychology and have performed primarily ancillary administrative functions in interdisciplinary clinical settings. Currently, however, psychologists are becoming increasingly visible in such primary leadership roles as directorships of mental health clinics and other mental health programs. Although psychologists are undertaking these major administrative roles, there appears to be little opportunity from them to engage in meaningful administrative functions in their professional graduate school or internship training. In contrast, psychiatric residents are given opportunities to develop administrative skills through chief resident positions in hospitals and clinics. Recognizing the need for such experiences in preparation for professional careers in clinical psychology, a specific administrative rotation was developed in 1972 as part of the clinical psychology internship program at Duke University Medical Center. This 3-month chief intern rotation, which is available to four trainees each year, originally arose out of both training concerns and practical needs associated with the Psychodiagnostic Laboratory at Duke Medical Center. Informal feedback from interns suggests that the experience is useful in giving them a taste of administrative work and in helping them to decide whether they would like to be involved in administration as a part of their professional careers.

The NYC area contains multiple EM residencies and as a result, numerous educators are concentrated in this region. In addition, highly desirable grand rounds speakers may limit repetitive travel to any single region, thereby preventing multiple residency exposures to them. Educational Objectives: We sought to create a sustainable and innovative region-wide EM educational program for all learners in the NYC metropolitan area. A steering committee representing multiple residency programs was formed to design curriculum and to plan educational events. The All NYC Emergency Medicine Conference, Inc [All NYC EM] was registered as a 501(c) (3) nonprofit entity with steering committee members serving on its inaugural board. Curricular Design: All NYC EM hosts spring and fall conferences each year featuring local educators and prominent guest speakers from around the nation. Conferences are themed and have evolved to include multiple short lectures, panel discussions and resident lecture competitions. All NYC EM has also launched an EM Education fellowship (offering funding to Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors and iTEACH), an annual chief resident forum and a medical student residency application boot camp. Impact/Effectiveness: Since its inception, All NYC EM has hosted 7 conferences, 2 chief forums, 1 medical student boot camp and supported 2 fellows. Attendance at the regional conference continues to grow. 533 residents, students and faculty representing 18 EM residencies attended All NYC 7 in April of 2014. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with a satisfaction score of 4.1 on a 1-5 Likert scale in regards to education content and usefulness in April, 2014.

Conventional thinking holds that the most senior individual is the most capable of serving in a leadership role as chief resident; our experience has shown, however, that selecting chief residents from the PGY 3 class of a 4-year residency program is not only feasible and well received by our residents, our residency training program, and our department, but is invaluable to the development of all individuals in the PGY 4 class regardless of whether or not they served as a chief resident.

The purpose of this study was to ascertain how chief residents could be involved more formally in improving the quality of care in a major public teaching hospital. METHOD: Fourteen chief residents on the major services at Boston City Hospital participated in early 1994 in either a focus group or an individual interview. Data were analyzed qualitatively using a grounded-theory methodology. RESULTS: The chief residents saw themselves as central to service delivery, teaching, and administration of the hospital. While they identified many role conflicts and system obstacles to providing quality patient care, they were uniformly positive about the contributions they made to Boston City Hospital and its patient population. They distinguished between formal QA and the major improvements they made on their services. Very few knew much about CQI methodology. CONCLUSIONS: Given increasing competition as a result of the rapid growth in managed care, hospitals with residency programs, especially public hospitals, must integrate their teaching programs into patient care models. Chief residents and the housestaff they supervise receive little training in CQI methods. As housestaff will be training and practicing in an environment where costs and quality will be intertwined, chief residents, with their credibility, contacts, and concern, can help incorporate CQI into the environment of graduate medical education.","Eliastam, M     Mizrahi, T     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Acad Med. 1996 Jun;71(6):670-4.

"",Urology resident training in BPH surgery does not reflect national trends toward increased utilization of office-based procedures,2009,1,1,Journal of Urology,,181,4,824,"Elliott, S. P. and Sweet, R. M.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L70114381,English,,,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that rates of minimally invasive surgical technology (MIST) for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) increased 439% between 1999-2005 in the male Medicare population. Laser prostatectomy increased 446%. TUNA increased 700%. TUMT increased 424%. Simultaneously, rates for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) decreased 39%. Overall there was a 28% increase in rates of BPH surgery. It is important to understand whether urology resident training mimics such trends in community practice. As residency training is primarily hospital-based, we hypothesized there would be similar trends in hospital-based procedures (increase in laser prostatectomy and decrease in TURP) but that there would be no increase in office-based procedures (TUMT, TUNA). METHODS: We reviewed the aggregate numbers of BPH surgeries performed by chief residents graduating from 4-year urology training programs in 2001-2008. Annual rates of BPH surgeries performed were calculated as = aggregate number of procedures per year/number of graduating chief residents in that year? number of years of residency). Results were plotted against those we previously reported in the Medicare population and trends were compared. RESULTS: Overall BPH procedures rates among graduating chief residents changed little over the study period (decreased 4%). Rates of laser prostatectomy and TURP followed trends similar to the community (increased 839% and decreased 27%, respectively). While TUNA increased 51% and TUMT decreased 54%, their overall rates were so low (about 1 procedure per every 20 chiefs per year) that trends were of little impact. CONCLUSIONS: Overall BPH surgery rates in residency training have remained stable, compared to a 28% increase in BPH surgeries nationwide. Residency training experience in hospital-based BPH surgery has mirrored the community experience in that TURPs have become fewer and laser prostatectomies more common. In contrast, office-based BPH procedures remain rare in residency training whereas they represent 30% of BPH procedures nationwide. These trends may represent the different experience at tertiary referral centers or the hospital-based focus of residency experience. Understanding these trends is important to planning residency education.","L70114381     2010-04-27 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

S.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: General surgery training has changed over the past decade due to the 80-hour work week and increasing demands on the surgery faculty to generate clinical revenue with ever decreasing reimbursements. The purpose of this study was to evaluate surgery resident productivity over the years and the surgery resident's contribution to clinical and basic research literature. METHOD: A PubMed literature search of all graduating chief residents (n = 95) over a 16-y period from a single university-based general surgery program were evaluated. Number and types of publications (clinical paper versus basic science paper) were analyzed for each resident. A cohort of residents graduating from the years 1990 to 1996 (n = 42) were deemed the early group and a cohort of residents graduating from the years 1999 to 2005 (n = 41) were deemed the late group. Residents graduating in 1997 and 1998 were deemed the washout group. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2005, there were 95 graduates with 204 published articles. Resident research time ranged from 0 to 2 y, with most residents spending 1 y of research time. In the early group, residents averaged 2.0 +/- 0.4 papers versus the late group where each resident published 2.6 +/- 0.5 papers (P = NS). In the early group, 24.4% of the papers were basic science in nature as opposed to the late group where 27.7% of the papers were with a basic science topic (P = NS, chi(2) analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Resident research productivity at a single university-based program with an elective research time does not appear to be deteriorating over time. A majority of research performed by residents is clinically oriented; however. basic science research does not appear to be decreasing. Careful scrutiny to resident research productivity is needed to ensure productive future academic surgeons.","1095-8673     Elliott, Steven T     Lee, Eugene S     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Res. 2009 May 1;153(1):148-51. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2008.03.029.

This study analyzed resident-reported gastric procedure experience by chief residents from U.S. programs. The Resident Statistic Summaries (Report C) for 1990-2001 were compiled and analyzed. Results are expressed as the average number of operations performed per resident, standard deviation (SD), and the percentage (%) of total gastric operative cases. For all gastric-related surgery, the average reported cases per chief resident ranged from 9.8-12.4 with a peak in 1990 and a nadir in 1999; in 2001 the reported case average was 11.3 (SD ranged from 6-8). Over the same interval, vagotomy decreased from 24% in 1990 to 7% in 2001, whereas gastric-reduction operations increased from 5%-34%. Total gastrectomy remained a constant less than 1.0 per chief resident (range 0.6-0.8), whereas partial gastric resection (PGR) was unchanged. The percentage of all types of gastric resections slightly diminished from 34% in 1990 to 29% in 2001.

We aim to describe the MMC reporting patterns of general surgery residents, describe the adverse event rate for patients and compare that with existing published rates, and describe the nature of our institutional adverse events. We hypothesize that reporting patterns and incidence rates will remain constant over time. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, archived MMC case lists were evaluated from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010. The reporting patterns of the residents, the adverse event ratios, and the specific categories of adverse events were described over the academic years. chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare across academic years, using an alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: There were 85 surgical MMC case lists evaluated. Services achieved a reporting rate above 80% (p < 0.001). The most consistent reporting was done by postgraduate year (PGY) 5 level chief residents for all services (p > 0.05). Out of 11,368 patients evaluated from complete MMC submissions, 289 patients had an adverse event reported (2.5%). This was lower than published reporting rates for patient adverse event rates (p < 0.001). Adverse event rates were consistent for residents at the postgraduate year 2, 4, and 5 levels for all services (p > 0.05). Over 2 years, 522 adverse events were reported for 461 patients. A majority of adverse events were from death (24.1%), hematologic and/or vascular events (16.7%), and gastrointestinal system events (16.1%).

We ranked 57 applicants in the National Residency Match Program (NRMP) in 1996 and matched our final eighth candidate with slot 22. Although clinically stellar, 4 of these 8 residents (50%) opted to switch to different medical specialties. We pondered if other programs had difficulties with the 1996 applicant pool and hypothesized that perhaps higher ranked applicants have greater attrition rates. METHODS: Programs in which our ranked applicants matched were contacted and asked for feedback on trainee performance, research time, attrition, and future plans. RESULTS: Four applicants did not match in GS. Fifty-three surgical interns (46 men, 7 women) in 1996 are now 23 chief residents, 18 senior residents (16 did research time, 1 did an intensive care unit fellowship, and 1 required a year of remediation), and 12 non-GS trainees (orthopedic surgery = 3, anesthesiology = 3, ENT = 1, family medicine = 1, internal medicine = 1, radiology = 1, pathology = 1, and Ph.D. researcher = 1). Clinical performance was similar for both GS trainees and those who dropped out. Residents dropped out after the PG-1 year (n = 7), PGY-2 (n = 3), and 1 each after PGY-3 and PGY-4. Higher ranked applicants were no more likely to drop out than were lower ranked applicants. CONCLUSIONS: Of Mayo Clinic-Rochester-ranked GS categorical applicants in 1996, 23% dropped out of GS. Eleven of 12 dropouts selected a different field of medicine to finish their training.

In response, leadership training programs have been developed within academic medical centers, business schools, and healthcare organizations; however, we are unaware of any well-developed programs for physicians-in-training. METHODS: To address this gap, we developed a two-day leadership development course for chief residents (CRs) at the Cleveland Clinic, framed around the concept of emotional intelligence. This paper describes our five-year experience with the CRs leadership program. RESULTS: Since inception, 105 CRs took the course; 81 (77%) completed before-and-after evaluations. Participants indicated that they had relatively little prior knowledge of the concepts that were presented and that the workshop greatly enhanced their familiarity with leadership competencies. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses indicated that attendees valued the training, especially in conflict resolution and teamwork, and indicated specific action plans for applying these skills. Furthermore, the workshop spurred some participants to express plans to learn more about leadership competencies. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends prior experience in offering an emotional intelligence-based leadership workshop for CRs.

19725954,Assessment of the capacity to consent to treatment in patients admitted to acute medical wards,2009,1,1,BMC Med Ethics,1472-6939,10,,15,"Fassassi, S. and Bianchi, Y. and Stiefel, F. and Waeber, G.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of capacity to consent to treatment is an important legal and ethical issue in daily medical practice. In this study we carefully evaluated the capacity to consent to treatment in patients admitted to an acute medical ward using an assessment by members of the medical team, the specific Silberfeld's score, the MMSE and an assessment by a senior psychiatrist. METHODS: Over a 3 month period, 195 consecutive patients of an internal medicine ward in a university hospital were included and their capacity to consent was evaluated within 72 hours of admission. RESULTS: Among the 195 patients, 38 were incapable of consenting to treatment (unconscious patients or severe cognitive impairment) and 14 were considered as incapable of consenting by the psychiatrist (prevalence of incapacity to consent of 26.7%). Agreement between the psychiatrist's evaluation and the Silberfeld questionnaire was poor (sensitivity 35.7%, specificity 91.6%). Experienced clinicians showed a higher agreement (sensitivity 57.1%, specificity 96.5%). A decision shared by residents, chief residents and nurses was the best predictor for agreement with the psychiatric assessment (sensitivity 78.6%, specificity 94.3%). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of incapacity to consent to treatment in patients admitted to an acute internal medicine ward is high. While the standardized Silberfeld questionnaire and the MMSE are not appropriate for the evaluation of the capacity to consent in this setting, an assessment by the multidisciplinary medical team concurs with the evaluation by a senior psychiatrist.","1472-6939     Fassassi, Sylfa     Bianchi, Yanik     Stiefel, Friedrich     Waeber, Gerard     Journal Article     England     BMC Med Ethics. 2009 Sep 2;10:15. doi: 10.1186/1472-6939-10-15.

Information requested included the demographics of the training program, the structure of the emergency department (ED) rotation, and the chief residents' perceptions of the quality of precepting in the ED. Eighty three percent of 149 institutions responded. The mean number of pediatric patients/year is 21,241 (range 500-100,000), supplying approximately 500 to 700 patients/resident/year. A freestanding pediatric ED serves as the main training site in 50% of programs, and 3% do not use an ED at all. Case-by-case, one-on-one precepting occurs in 91% of EDs. Precepting is performed mostly by pediatric attendings (74%) and general emergency medicine attendings (38%). Seventy-four percent of programs provide a formal orientation, and 88% provide end-rotation evaluations. Twenty-two percent of the chief residents consider their pediatric ED rotation as ""average"" when compared with the case-by-case precepting delivered in other hospital rotations; 39% consider the ED rotation as ""above average,"" and 33% as ""below average."" Programs with core lecture series, skills workshops, and formal orientation and evaluation procedures are more likely to be regarded as ""above average."" Pediatric emergency medicine rotations provide ample opportunity for case-by-case precepting. Programs with an established curriculum and pediatric attending presence are more likely to be successful in this regard. The full potential of the ED rotation can be realized through faculty training in precepting and evaluation methods.","Fein, J A     Lavelle, J     Giardino, A P     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Pediatr Emerg Care. 1995 Aug;11(4):208-11.

Ratings of the degree of clinical autonomy allowed residents by 65 attending physicians--each of whom had a general internal medicine practice with a significant hospital component--were provided by 23 former internal medicine chief residents and 17 internal medicine residents who were in their third year at the time of the study. A regression model was used to test the association between hospital resource use (as shown by total hospital charges to patients and their lengths of stay) and the residents' mean ratings of the degrees of autonomy the attending physicians permitted residents, for 7,169 of these physicians' patients discharged between 1986 and 1989 in 28 diagnosis-related groups. The analysis was controlled for patients' insurance status and chronic disease comorbidities. The patients whose attending physicians were rated as allowing substantial clinical autonomy had significantly lower total charges and lengths of stay (p less than .0001). These results suggest that internal medicine residents have an inherently conservative practice style that values low-intensity workups and rapid discharge of patients.","Feinglass, J     Schroeder, J     Martin, G J     Wallace, W     Lyons, J     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Acad Med. 1991 Sep;66(9):549-52.

It appears that some house staff may be more vulnerable to stress than their peers (Gabbard 1985; Reuben 1985; Smith, Andrasik, & Quinn 1988). Hence individual differences are an important consideration in understanding the impact of residency training demands on house officers' abilities to effectively manage work-related stress. The present study describes the influence of personality styles, gender and year in training, on coping styles and health-related behaviors in 191 first, second and third year house officers in two specialties: pediatrics and internal medicine. Residents who experienced higher subjective distress reported more physical symptoms, less adequate self-health care and more use of potentially maladaptive coping strategies (e.g., denial and disengagement) than residents who demonstrated lower distress. Higher distressed residents were also rated by their chief residents as more frequently ill and more dissatisfied with their personal life. Significant differences were also observed between male and female residents and between first, second and third year residents. Female residents reported being more highly distressed and using more emotional and social support coping strategies than male residents. Female residents were also rated as more dissatisfied, angry and depressed than their male colleagues. First year residents were found to be less prepared for medical residency demands than their more advance peers. They reported less adequate self-health care practices and were rated as having lower overall competency by their chief residents compared with third year residents.

Setting and Participants: This program was designed for the Internal Medicine-Pediatrics Residency Program, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY. Participants included all current residents in the combined IM-Peds program (24 residents). Program leadership, chief residents, and core faculty may also use the program in a teaching/advisory role. Description: Two residents (Flemig and Salmon) developed a modular website under a private domain (ukmedipedia.com). The primary function of this website was to provide a centrally hosted schedule for our resident continuity clinic. We were later able to add a checklist of learning requirements for the program, a log for each resident's number of patients seen in each clinic session, and a consolidated conference calendar from separate residency programs. As the residency program evolves, so does the website. A new requirement for each resident to develop a patient education handout on a given rotation led to the creation of a Clinic Handouts section of the website. Residents receive brief advice on website functions at monthly program meetings. The website is password-protected. Evaluation: After 10 months of implementation, average use is 4.8 hits per resident, per month. Frequency of e-mails with draft clinic schedules and conference schedule updates have decreased. Residents regularly add their patient education materials to the site. The log of clinic visits formerly required residents to map a network drive, but this step is now eliminated. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: A program-native website may decrease the burden of nonclinical information for resident physicians by aggregating materials that might otherwise have required use of multiple online and print resources.

TheACGME CLER patient safety pathway emphasizes the role of residents in identifying, reporting, and understanding the importance of patient safety events. Despite frequent encounters with safety events, residents are historically known to under report. AIM STATEMENT: Understand resident perception of patient safety and medical errors, identify barriers to reporting, and increase total reports made by resident by 50%. INTERVENTIONS: An anonymous pre-intervention survey was distributed to residents at Phoenix Children's Hospital in September 2017. Questions included involvement in safety events, event reporting, barriers to reporting, and overall perception of patient safety. Following the survey, the Medial Director of Patient Safety and Quality led a conference on key safety topics. In January 2018, safety whiteboards were introduced into team workrooms as a visual reminder and to reduce time required by residents to outline safety events. Senior and/or chief residents will review these boards weekly and assist with submitting events online. MEASURES: Effectiveness of interventions will be measured using number of reports made by residents in the hospital online reporting system. RESULTS: The pre-intervention survey found that residents, on average, feel reporting safety events is important, rating it 4.5/5. In the month prior to survey, 48% of respondents reported being involved in a safety event, while only 13% reported this event. Identified reasons for not reporting include lack of knowledge of how to report (n = 35) and amount of work to report online (n = 32). Before interventions, residents on average placed 3-6 reports per month in the online reporting system. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS: Residents value patient safety event reporting and recognize its importance to patient care. However, there are many barriers to event reporting, most notably lack of knowledge and degree of difficulty in using the reporting system. We have implemented a basic whiteboard tool to improve speed of documentation. We are eager to collect data on number of patient safety events identified and recorded by residents post-implementation.

A. and Althouse, L. A. and Moran, L. M. and Spera, L.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The proportion of the newly graduated pediatric workforce that becomes hospitalists has been increasing slightly over the past decade. However, it is unknown what proportion of those who accept hospitalist positions as their first job intend to remain in the field longer term. This is important to workforce projections regarding the magnitude of those who will function in this role. METHODS: The American Board of Pediatrics incorporated a structured questionnaire within the online application process to the General Pediatrics certification application. Respondents identified as residents or chief residents who selected ""hospitalist position"" as their immediate postresidency plan were the focus this study. We compared survey responses by gender and location of the medical school attended. RESULTS: Since the initiation of the general pediatrics certification examination application survey, 6335 completed the questionnaire. 79% (n=5001) were either in residency training or were a chief resident. Of those, 8% (n=376) reported they planned to work as a pediatric hospitalist immediately after completing residency. Fewer than half (43%; n=161) reported this to be their long-term career plan. This finding varied by both medical school type and by gender. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatric residents and chief residents who take hospitalist positions immediately after training do not intend for hospital practice to be the long-term focus of their careers. As the field of hospital medicine continues to develop, understanding career trajectories can help inform current and future efforts regarding the potential for different mechanisms for training and certification.","Freed, Gary L     McGuinness, Gail A     Althouse, Linda A     Moran, Lauren M     Spera, Laura     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Hosp Pediatr. 2015 Apr;5(4):169-74. doi: 10.1542/hpeds.2014-0168.

B.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Debate exists within the surgical education community about whether 5 years is sufficient time to train a general surgeon, whether graduating chief residents are confident in their skills, why residents choose to do fellowships, and the scope of general surgery practice today. STUDY DESIGN: In May 2013, a 16-question online survey was sent to every general surgery program director in the United States for dissemination to each graduating chief resident (CR). RESULTS: Of the 297 surveys returned, 76% of CRs trained at university programs, 81% trained at 5-year programs, and 28% were going directly into general surgery practice. The 77% of CRs who had done >950 cases were significantly more comfortable than those who had done less (p < 0.0001). Only a few CRs were uncomfortable performing a laparoscopic colectomy (7%) or a colonoscopy (6%), and 80% were comfortable being on call at a Level I trauma center. Compared with other procedures, CRs were most uncomfortable with open common bile duct explorations (27%), pancreaticoduodenectomies (38%), hepatic lobectomies (48%), and esophagectomies (60%) (p < 0.00001). Of those going into fellowships, 67% said they truly had an interest in that specialty and only 7% said it was because they were not confident in their surgical skills. CONCLUSIONS: Current graduates of general surgery residencies appear to be confident in their skills, including care of the trauma patient. Fellowships are being chosen primarily because of an interest in the subspecialty. General surgery residency no longer provides adequate training in esophageal or hepatopancreatobiliary surgery.","1879-1190     Friedell, Mark L     VanderMeer, Thomas J     Cheatham, Michael L     Fuhrman, George M     Schenarts, Paul J     Mellinger, John D     Morris, Jon B     Journal Article     United States     J Am Coll Surg. 2014 Apr;218(4):695-703. doi: 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2013.12.022.

In an era when nanotechnology is being both incorporated into educational requirements for medical fields such as radiology and oncology and vigorously pursued and developed by cosmeceutical companies, dermatology is falling behind. A survey was conducted to ascertain knowledge, attitudes and perception of nanotechnology in dermatology teaching programs. METHODS: To ascertain baseline knowledge, attitudes and preceptions regarding nanotechnology among dermatology trainees, dermatology investigators and dermatology faculty in US academic medical centers, an online survey was sent out to random members of the dermatology community and data analyzed (100 participants, 23% response rate). Participants responded to a questionnaire on a five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree, disagree, uncertain, agree, to strongly agree. Due to the low response rate, strongly disagree/disagree and strongly agree/agree values were combined and compared to uncertain responses. RESULTS: Approximately equal numbers of faculty vs. chief residents responded to the survery (52% vs. 47.75%, respectively). The majority of respondents had not previously attended any educational activity on nanotechnology (69.57%). The majority of participants agreed that more education on nanotechnology for dermatologists is needed (78.26% agreed vs. 21.74% uncertain) and that it should be incorporated into the residency training curriculum (60.87% agree vs. 13.04% disagree). Participants mostly agreed that nanotechnology research can contribute to better fundamental understanding of skin disease (78.26%), to advances in the diagnosis of skin disease (73.91%) and to therapies (78.26%). Participants mostly agreed that more research is needed (82.60%) and that this research should be funded (78.26%). Not surprisingly, respondents were uncertain with respect to issues of nanotechnology safety both in the pharmaceutical realm (60.87%) and cosmeceutical realm (69.57%). Furthermore, the overwhelming majority responded that research is also needed to evaluate nanomaterial safety (86.96%). LIMITATIONS: Both the populations size and response rate were low, possibly affecting the power and significance of the results in this study. CONCLUSION: The survey results indicate a significant gap in dermatology training. Participants indicated a need for more training and education in the area of nanotechnology, and called for more research to evaluate the potential pitfalls associated with nanomaterials as well and to seek new advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.","Friedman, Adam     Nasir, Adnan     Journal Article     United States     J Drugs Dermatol. 2011 Sep;10(9):1037-41.

H.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622966786,English,,,"RATIONALE: Housestaff provide the bulk of care to dying patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite this, the literature demonstrates few studies evaluating coping tools for those engaged with end of life care and death. Our housestaff have expressed a desire for more directed ICU debriefing. METHODS: Our ICU has an established weekly quality improvement process of reviewing deaths called the Rapid Mortality Review (RMR). In the RMR housestaff provide a succinct case summary of the deaths from the previous week. Beginning October 2016, we added a debriefing component facilitated by a proctor or a Medicine Chief Resident. This activity employed two questions with the aim of providing additional support surrounding a patient's death. First, we asked, do you have any other concerns about how care was provided to this patient or find yourself notably bothered by this death for any other reason? If yes, this was followed with, do you feel comfortable saying more? At the conclusion of the session the participants were provided a questionnaire that was anonymously completed. RESULTS: On review of the survey data comprised of Likert questions (5 categories of response, from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) and an open-ended question aimed at assessing the value of the debriefing exercise the response to the intervention was positive. When asked if it helped me cope with the death of a patient the average response was 3.82 (SD 0.61). In response to if the debrief was a valuable use of time the average response was 4.1 (SD 0.47). The timing of the debrief was felt to be appropriate with a response average of 4.1 (SD 0.61). The majority of the open ended answers to what was useful or what could be improved were positive with many expressing the value of timely reflection. Surprisingly when asked if they had discussed this death prior to their participation at the RMR session, 45% reported that they had no previous opportunity to outwardly reflect on the death of their patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with an RMR based approach to resident debriefing has been well received by housestaff. It offers a structured and timely opportunity for reflection that requires minimal resources or time investment. Moving forward efforts may be made to determine if debriefing sessions have an impact on the rates of burnout and the overall quality of life of housestaff while working in the ICU.","L622966786     2018-07-16 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

K. and Farley, D. R.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical training programs often lack objective assessment strategies. Complicated scheduling characteristics frequently make it difficult for surgical residents to undergo formal assessment; actually having the time and opportunity to remediate poor performance is an even greater problem. We developed a novel methodology of assessment for residents and created an efficient remediation system using a combination of simulation, online learning, and self-assessment options. DESIGN: Postgraduate year (PGY) 2 to 5 general surgery (GS) residents were tested in a 5 station, objective structured clinical examination style event called the Surgical X-Games. Stations were 15 minutes in length and tested both surgical knowledge and technical skills. Stations were scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = Fail, 2 = Mediocre, 3 = Pass, 4 = Good, and 5 = Stellar). Station scores </= 2 were considered subpar and required remediation to a score >/= 4. Five remediation sessions allowed residents the opportunity to practice the stations with staff surgeons. Videos of each skill or test of knowledge with clear instructions on how to perform at a stellar level were offered. Trainees also had the opportunity to checkout take-home task trainers to practice specific skills. Residents requiring remediation were then tested again in-person or sent in self-made videos of their performance. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: PGY2, 3, 4, and 5 GS residents at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. RESULTS: A total of, 35 residents participated in the Surgical X-Games in the spring of 2015. Among all, 31 (89%) had scores that were deemed subpar on at least 1 station. Overall, 18 (58%) residents attempted remediation. All 18 (100%) achieved a score >/= 4 on the respective stations during a makeup attempt. Overall X-Games scores and those of PGY2s, 3s, and 4s were higher after remediation (p < 0.05). No PGY5s attempted remediation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite difficulties with training logistics and busy resident schedules, it is feasible to objectively assess most GS trainees and offer opportunities to remediate if performance is poor. Our multifaceted remediation methodology allowed 18 residents to achieve good or stellar performance on each station after deliberate practice. Enticing chief residents to participate in remediation efforts in the spring of their final year of training remains a work in progress.","1878-7452     Gas, Becca L     Buckarma, EeeLN H     Mohan, Monali     Pandian, T K     Farley, David R     Comparative Study     Evaluation Studies     Journal Article     Review     United States     J Surg Educ. 2016 Nov - Dec;73(6):e71-e76. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.07.002.

Background: During the ninetieth and twentieth centuries clinicians, anatomists and pathologists performed a considerable work in the field of Neurology. Special credit should be given to Pierre Marie, an eminent French neurologist of the early twentieth century. Design/method: Historical review. Results: Pierre Marie (18531940) was a prominent member of the French neurological world of the early twentieth century and a brilliant student of Charcot. At the end of his residency he defended his M.D. thesis on Graves's disease and became chief resident under the direction of Charcot. Together, they described a condition characterized by progressive muscular atrophy, later known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Along with Édouard Brissaud, he founded the journal Revue Neurologique in 1893, and the Société de Neurologie de Paris in 1899, of which he was the first General Secretary. He was appointed interne des hôpitaux de Paris in 1878 and associate professor at the Bicêtre Hospital and later at the Salpêtrière Hospital, in 1895 and 1911 respectively. He described acromegaly, cerebellar tonsil herniation, hereditary cerebellar ataxia, hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, hereditary cleidocranial dysostosis and rhizomelic spondylosis, as well as contributing to the study of bone and joint pathology. His work on aphasia was opposed to that of Paul Broca and Karl Wernicke, which resulted in several famous and intense debates with Dejerine in 1908. Pierre Marie published various works dedicated to the neurological sequels due to World War I injuries in collaboration with Charles Foix and Henry Meige. At the age of 64, he took over from Dejerine as the chairman of the Clinic of Nervous Diseases until his retirement in 1923. Conclusion: Pierre Marie's researches led to an incontestable growth of the medical sciences that transcended his time.","L71922800     2015-06-29 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"
"",The professionalism matrix: A tool to teach and evaluate professionalism,2013,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,28,,S485,"Geslani, V. and Loo, L. and Baz, S. and Tudtud-Hans, L.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71293765,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: While professionalism is a widely accepted core clinical competency, students residents, and faculty often disagree whether certain actions are unprofessional or not. What constitutes a breach of professional conduct often requires an understanding of the context of the situation and reasoning by those involved. We developed a tool, the Professionalism Matrix, that was incorporated into a case based educational conference with the specific goals of describing the challenges in defining professionalism, recognizing professionalism as a competency, and using the Professionalism Matrix as a systematic approach to teach and evaluate professionalism. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We have applied the Professionalism Matrix in 3 interactive conferences to date-the first for house staff in our Internal Medicine (IM) residency, the second at our annual institutional chief residents conference that included all departmental specialties and finally in a University wide faculty development session that had representatives from the School of Medicine, Nursing and related Allied Health professionals. DESCRIPTION: The Professionalism Matrix incorporates the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME) definition of Professionalism along with the American Board of Internal Medicne's (ABIM) 10 related milestones, cross-referencing this with a systems-based practice definition that considers the context of the situation. The contextual framework includes 3 levels: the Micro level (or behavior that is influenced by the individuals' knowledge, skills, beliefs, and attitudes); the Meso level (or behavior that is influenced by the immediate organizational structure such as the School of Medicine, Department or residency program); and finally the Macro level (or behavior that is influenced by national organizations, policies or trends within the United States). Based on the authors' actual experiences, a series of clinical vignettes are presented with situations that pose opportunities for potentially unprofessional behavior. Participants are broken into small groups and each is given one clinical vignette to discuss the observable actions within the context of the Professionalism Matrix and the possible clinical reasoning of those involved. An audience response system polls the larger group as to what they believe the individual in the vignette should do versus what they actually do in the particular situation. Small groups then report their discussions using the Professionalism Matrix as a framework for how the context and reasoning of those involved might explain the potentially unprofessional behaviors reported in each vignette. EVALUATION: Conference evaluations have been uniformly positive that the Professionalism Matrix facilitated a systems-based practice approach to the interpretation of potentially unprofessional conduct. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: The small and large group discussions highlighted the importance of considering the micro, meso, and macro levels that may have influenced individuals reasoning and motivations for seemingly unprofessional actions. Whether these simulations actually translate into actual behavioral changes by participants still remains to be determined. This integration of the ACGME's definition of professionalism, the ABIM/ACGME related milestones, cross-referenced with a systembased framework to analyze issues contextually makes the Professionalism Matrix a novel educational tool that could readily be adopted by other institutions.","L71293765     2014-01-28 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>true}"

However, the educational value of this experience has not been carefully examined. A 32-item questionnaire was developed to assess curricular components of the three phases of the transport experience in residency training: phase 1 included pretransport training and qualifications and curricular planning, phase 2 addressed intratransport phone backup for the team analogous to online medical command, and phase 3 included posttransport feedback and performance evaluation. The study also addressed the chief residents' perception of the roles of the resident and transport nurse working on the team. The survey was mailed to chief residents at 76 pediatric residency programs in the United States. Data were received from 75 programs for a return rate of 98%. Fifty-four programs that used residents for transport team staffing were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Of the respondents, 39% report a specific training process prior to transport. Twenty-two percent of programs provide residents with written materials such as a manual or course syllabus. Eighty-two percent have a senior physician always identified for phone backup. Fifty-two percent of programs have no specific method for team evaluation and 31% rely only on informal verbal feedback. Thirty percent routinely provide feedback within one week of the transport. Sixty-three percent of chief residents view the experienced transport nurse as an equal member of the transport team.

In this largely urban sample, minority recruitment and retention was reported as an explicit priority by 40% of pediatric chief residents. The majority (71%) reported that their house staff recruitment committees had no explicitly defined recruitment goals regarding minority house staff. Seventy-seven percent reported that within their departments, recruitment efforts toward minorities were no different than for nonminorities. Overall, few minority house staff and minority faculty were identified in the responding institutions. The most frequently reported intra-institutional support systems for minority house staff included individual pairing with faculty advisors from the same minority group (29%), an affirmative-action office located at the institution (8%), and the existence of a minority faculty support group (4%). These results indicate that pediatric chief residents may not be fully aware of the specific challenges related to the recruitment and retention of minority physicians, and most house staff recruitment committees do not have explicit goals in this regard.","Giardino, A P     Cooper, M C     Journal Article     United States     J Natl Med Assoc. 1999 Aug;91(8):459-65.

G. and King, J. and Giardino, E. R. and Woodward, G. A. and Durbin, D. R.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: : The focus was to examine the educational structure and curricular planning involved in current pediatric emergency interhospital transport teams that use resident physicians as members of the team and to compare these current results with the findings from 2 previous, similar surveys complete during the past 2 decades. METHODS: : A 33-item questionnaire, assessing curricular components of the transport experience, was sent to a chief resident at all the officially listed nonmilitary pediatric residency program in contiguous United States. Comparisons were done for each similar item on all 3 questionnaires. RESULTS: : After 3 rounds of mailing and telephone follow-up to nonresponders, the overall response rates for the 2006 and 1998 surveys were 81% (n = 156) and 89% (n = 173), respectively. A similar survey on a smaller sample, published in 1990, used for comparison, had a response rate of 99% (n = 75). When asked about training provided to residents before going on transport, respondents varied in the specific experiences and skills required of the residents. In addition, programs reported variation in team backup during the pediatric emergency transport. The most common method of evaluation for the resident on completion of the transport was ""no specific method"" as reported by 62% of respondents in 2006 compared with 50% in 1998 and 55% in 1990 (P = not significant). The percentage of programs providing informal verbal feedback was reduced significantly in 2006 as compared with that in 1998 (P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: : The educational structure for residents serving in pediatric emergency interhospital transport teams remains variable, and the full educational value of pediatric transports continues to be somewhat unrealized particularly in the area of posttransport performance feedback and evaluation. Having medical command available has consistently been a strong point of the residents' experience on the transport team.","1535-1815     Giardino, Angelo P     Tran, Xuan G     King, Jason     Giardino, Eileen R     Woodward, George A     Durbin, Dennis R     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Pediatr Emerg Care. 2010 Sep;26(9):653-8. doi: 10.1097/PEC.0b013e3181ef0473.

METHODS: Obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) chief residents were asked to rate the importance of teaching various skills, how often conflict situations arose, and to identify training that would be helpful through a national web-based survey. An e-mail was sent to coordinators of the Residency Review Committee (RRC) O&G residency programmes with a request that they forward the link to their chief residents three times from January through March 2006. RESULTS: Responses were received from 204 postgraduate Year 4 (PGY4) residents (18% of all PGY4 residents) from 133 programmes (54% of all residency programmes) and 33 states. Teaching junior residents how to prioritise patient care and obtain critical information in an emergent situation was considered very to extremely important by 97%. Conflict situations with junior residents were reported to occur between one and five times by 41-58%; an additional 26-28% reported that these situations occurred six or more times. Residents felt it would be helpful to extremely helpful to have training in resolving conflicts that involved patient care (48-59%), as well as in resolving conflict among junior residents, communicating effectively with them and becoming an effective leader (65-78%).

A ""flipped classroom"" model, in which residents prepare ahead of time for mentored topic discussions, has potential advantages. METHODS: We implemented a curriculum consisting of topics distributed across the specialty. Weekly, each resident was randomly assigned to research a specific aspect of an assigned topic appropriate to his or her level of experience: junior residents about what characterizes each clinical entity, midlevel residents about when to intervene, and chief residents about how to administer treatment. Residents completed an anonymous survey 6 months after implementation. Board examination performance was assessed before and after implementation. RESULTS: A total of 12 residents participated in the program. Weekly, 1.75+/-0.40 hours were spent in preparation, with senior residents reporting less time than junior residents. All residents indicated that the accumulation of experience across 7 years of residency was a major advantage of this program, and all preferred it to lectures. Performance on the board examination significantly increased after implementation (from 316+/-36 to 468+/-45, p<0.05).

There is a lack of professional development programs specifically designed for chief residents. Objective In 2015, Academic Life in Emergency Medicine designed and implemented an annual, year-long, training program and virtual community of practice for chief residents in emergency medicine (EM). This study describes the curriculum design process and reports measures of learner engagement during the first two cycles of the curriculum. Methods Kern's Six-Step Approach for curriculum development informed key decisions in the design and implementation of the Chief Resident Incubator. The resultant curriculum was created using constructivist social learning theory, with specific objectives that emphasized the needs for a virtual community of practice, longitudinal content delivery, mentorship for participants, and the facilitation of multicenter digital scholarship. The 12-month curriculum included 11 key administrative or professional development domains, delivered using a combination of digital communications platforms. Primary outcomes measures included markers of learner engagement with the online curriculum, recognized as modified Kirkpatrick Level One outcomes for digital learning. Results An average of 206 chief residents annually enrolled in the first two years of the curriculum, with an overall participation by 33% (75/227) of the allopathic EM residency programs in the United States (U.S.). There was a high level of learner engagement, with an average 13,414 messages posted per year. There were also 42 small group teaching sessions held online, which included 39 faculty and 149 chief residents. The monthly e-newsletter had a 50.7% open rate. Digital scholarship totaled 23 online publications in two years, with 67 chief resident co-authors and 21 faculty co-authors. Conclusions The Chief Resident Incubator is a virtual community of practice that provides longitudinal training and mentorship for EM chief residents. This incubator conceptual framework may be used to design similar professional development curricula across various health professions using an online digital platform.","Gisondi, Michael A     Chou, Adaira     Joshi, Nikita     Sheehy, Margaret K     Zaver, Fareen     Chan, Teresa M     Riddell, Jeffrey     Sifford, Derek P     Lin, Michelle     Journal Article     United States     Cureus. 2018 Feb 24;10(2):e2223. doi: 10.7759/cureus.2223.

M.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To compare management strategies for pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among physicians with different specialty training. METHODS: We conducted a mail survey of 1000 randomly selected physicians, including 200 pediatric endocrinologists, 200 general emergency physicians, 200 pediatric emergency physicians, 200 pediatric intensivists, and 200 pediatric chief residents. We posed questions regarding a hypothetical 10-year-old patient with new onset of diabetes mellitus who is approximately 10% dehydrated but alert, with venous pH of 7.1 and serum glucose concentration of 34.7 mmol/L (625 mg/dL). Questions involved the rate of rehydration, content of intravenous fluids, insulin therapy, potassium replacement, use of sodium bicarbonate, and adjustments in therapy for decreasing serum glucose concentration. We compared responses of physicians in each specialty and used multiple regression analysis to adjust for potential confounding variables, including number of years in practice, number of children with DKA seen per month, and practice setting. RESULTS: Five hundred eighty-one physicians (58.1%) completed the survey, with responses demonstrating significant, consistent differences between specialties. Extremes of responses included the following: (1) 59% of endocrinologists vs 11% of general emergency physicians would give an initial fluid bolus of less than 20 mL/kg (odds ratio [OR], 11.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0-27.7) (P < .001); (2) 83.5% of general emergency physicians vs 42.5% of pediatric intensivists would administer an initial insulin bolus (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.0-8.7) (P < .001); (3) 58.2% of pediatric intensivists vs 9% of general emergency physicians would replace fluids over a period of greater than 24 hours (OR, 14.1; 95% CI, 5.5-37.5) (P < .001); and (4) 54.3% of general emergency physicians vs 7.3% of pediatric intensivists would use potassium chloride alone for potassium replacement (OR, 10.8; 95% CI, 5.0-23.8) (P < .001). All of these differences persisted after adjusting for the potential confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial differences exist in the management of pediatric DKA among physicians of different specialties, presumably due to differences in specialty training. These differences obscure our ability to evaluate the treatment of DKA and highlight the necessity for further studies comparing the outcomes of different treatment strategies.","Glaser, N S     Kuppermann, N     Yee, C K     Schwartz, D L     Styne, D M     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1997 Nov;151(11):1125-32.

RESULTS: Participants (N = 348) initiated the survey representing 28.4%, 25.6%, and 19.0% postgraduate year 1, 2, and 3 residents, respectively, as well as 17.5% chief residents/fellows and 9.5% attendings. Participants rated their prior education as none or fair regarding recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (63.8%) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (68.3%). In contrast, 60.6% and 70.9% rated their education on genital warts and cervical cancer correspondingly as good or excellent. When asked what was routinely discussed during HPV vaccine counseling, 63.3% reported ""never"" discussing recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and 52.9% ""never"" discussing oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. A range from 92.7% to 95.5% responded that there was a need for increased education regarding HPV and its role in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Increased education about HPV and its otolaryngology-related manifestations should be undertaken to increase provider, patient, and parent awareness of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. We propose that discussing the risks of otolaryngology-related disease be routinely included in HPV vaccination counseling.","1097-6817     Gnagi, Sharon H     Gnagi, Forrest T     Schraff, Scott A     Hinni, Michael L     Journal Article     England     Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2016 Jul;155(1):87-93. doi: 10.1177/0194599816639932.

The Dalkon Shield was associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and in 1985 its manufacturer, A.H. Robins Company, went bankrupt. A new study from WHO showed no increased risk of PID among IUD users at low risk for sexually transmitted diseases, although the risk of PID appears to be greater in the 1st month after insertion. With proper patient selection IUDs are a good contraceptive choice for many women. US and international staff members of the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception (AVSC) were among professionals at a New York conference of IUD use in developed and developing countries. The current copper-bearing IUD (Copper T 380A) is effective for up to 8 years, but is also appropriate for shorter-term use. A study was presented about women who had their IUDs removed: 80% became pregnant within the 1st year and 95% within 3 years after removal. A longterm, continuing study of the Copper T 380A found it safe, effective, long-lasting, and inexpensive to manufacture. The Copper T 380A was 1st marketed in the US in 1988. Because of its long-term effectiveness, the Copper T 380A is a possible alternative for women who desire no children but have decided against surgical sterilization. A survey revealed that only 27% of US obstetrics and gynecology training programs teach IUD insertion and removal, and 37% of chief residents have never inserted an IUD. The conference examined new copper and hormonal IUDs, including levonorgestrel-releasing IUD which is effective for up to 5 years (LNG-20) expected to be approved for use in the US by 1995. More than 20 presenters addressed IUD performance, mechanisms of action, complications and their prevention, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and postremoval conception rates.     eng","Goldberg, B     Journal Article     United States     AVSC News. 1992 Jul;30(2):7-8.

L. and Wipf, J.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L615582134,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care providers face increasing patient care and administrative responsibilities with time pressures, leading to decreased job satisfaction and higher rates of burnout. One proposed solution is transitioning primary care delivery toward a team-based, interprofessional model. Toward that end, the Seattle VA Center of Excellence in Primary Care Education (CoEPCE) aims to transform primary care education out of silos; with a shared educational curriculum for primary care internal medicine residents and nurse practitioner trainees as well as associated health professionals including pharmacists and psychologists. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We describe a recent innovation in our CoEPCE in which pharmacy residents, psychology fellows, and dermatology chief residents are now co-located with attending physicians and nurse practitioner preceptors in the Seattle VA Primary Care Clinic precepting room 1-2 half days per week. These interprofessional consultants offer real-time consultative services to internal medicine residents and nurse practitioner trainees seeing clinic patients; with a shared goal of enhancing integrated patient care and expanding trainee interprofessional learning and collaboration. DESCRIPTION: The IP consultants engage with the primary care IM resident and NP trainees in one or more of the following ways: Scrubbing: the IP consultant reviews charts of scheduled patients and communicates recommendations to the trainee prior to the visit. Staffing: the IP consultant observes the patient presentation and provides recommendations to the trainee. Shared appointment: the IP consultant sees the patient along with or immediately after the trainee. EVALUATION: Focus group evaluations of both the IM/NP trainee and the IP consultants' perceptions of the redesigned precepting room were highly positive. The psychology fellows observed that nearly half of their consultations were informal 5-10 min staffing interactions. They were able to model advanced communication skills and noted increased warm hand-offs for mental health conditions. Pharmacy residents cited examples of positively impacting care of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Pharmacy and IM residents noted instances in which scrubbing led to improved care, such as identification of a medication error prescribed in another clinic. Dermatology chief residents enjoyed teaching problem-based skin exams and differential diagnosis. The IMresidents/NP trainees reported these interactions to be highly educational, and patients voiced appreciation for the real time dermatology consultation. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: In our experience, IP consultants are a rich addition to the primary care precepting room. Primary care traineesmore frequently seek out their colleagues to help manage complex patients; and utilize skills they learn from colleagues, e.g. a pharmacist's approach to insulin titration or a psychologist's approach to motivational interviewing.","L615582134     2017-04-26 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Applications for fellowship positions are submitted during the third year of residency. We compared the number of residents undertaking fellowship, accepting jobs, and rescinding accepted fellowship positions to accept jobs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the 47th Association of University Radiologists meeting, participants from the American Association of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology completed a questionnaire regarding the intentions of third- and fourth-year residents in their programs. RESULTS: Seventy programs, representing 402 fourth-year and 395 third-year residents, responded. Of fourth-year residents, 322 (80.1%) accepted fellowships and 41 (10.2%) accepted jobs. Of third-year residents, 335 (84.8%) accepted fellowships. Eighty-eight (27.3%) fourth-year residents and 95 third-year residents (28.4%) accepted interventional radiology fellowships, and 104 (32.3%) fourth-year residents and 96 (28.7%) third-year residents accepted body imaging fellowships. Most residents who accepted fellowships did so in the same city in which they completed their residency training. Of fourth-year residents who accepted fellowship positions the year before, 14 (4.3%) withdrew their acceptance to pursue employment. CONCLUSION: Most residents opt for fellowship training in interventional radiology or body imaging.

We hypothesized that surgical residents define incision class (IC) accurately compared with an attending NSQIP surgeon champion (SC). METHODS: We evaluated our NSQIP database from April 1, 2015, to December 31, 2016, including cases in which a resident was present and IC was documented. Cases in which the resident, circulator, or surgical clinical rater disagreed on the IC were then reviewed by a blinded SC. RESULTS: Residents were correct in 83.6% of the cases, with PGY 5 persons having the lowest accuracy. Class 3 incisions were most often misclassified (36%). A disproportionate number of misclassifications by PGY4 and PGY5-7 residents occurred in incision classes 2 and 3. Surgical site infections occurred in 7.4% of cases, ranging from 2.4% in IC 1 to 15.7% in IC 4 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall accuracy appears reasonable, it is of concern that incisions at higher risk of infection (contaminated) were least likely to be classified appropriately. Chief residents, who often are making the decisions on incision closure, were the least accurate in determining IC. This may have a deleterious impact on incision management, suggesting a need for directed resident education on IC and further investigation to determine its impact on site infection risk and patient outcomes.","1557-8674     Goodwin, Jessica     Womack, Pepper     Moore, Billy     Laureano Phillips, J     Duane, Therese     Journal Article     United States     Surg Infect (Larchmt). 2017 Nov/Dec;18(8):874-878. doi: 10.1089/sur.2017.088.

"",An 8-module intern night float curriculum: Enhancing the educational value of intern night float and the teaching skills of senior residents,2012,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,27,,S551,"Goss, E. J. and Arad, D.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71297550,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: In order to adhere to increased intern work hour restrictions, many internal medicine residency programs have increased the amount of time interns spend on overnight rotations like night float. Night float systems have been associated with reduced medical errors, but they have also been associated with dissatisfaction with the learning environment, and do not improve standardized testing scores. Overnight residents are well situated to be teachers for night floats. In addition, recent LCME guidelines suggest that residency programs formalize resident as teacher training. To enhance the educational experience of interns on night float and teaching skills of senior residents, we developed an interactive night float curriculum delivered by senior residents to night float interns. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Internal Medicine interns at MMC complete one to two, 2-week blocks of night float at either of two university hospital locations in the Bronx, NY. Four senior residents rotate through a medicine consult rotation monthly at the Moses campus. Senior residents deliver the pilot curriculum to interns at the Moses campus; interns on night float at Weiler campus receive their regular orientation. DESCRIPTION: Senior and chief residents collaborated to design eight 30-minute evidence-based and interactive powerpoint modules along with example signouts. Modules simulate relevant clinical scenarios and focus on acute management of high yield topics such as chest pain, hypotension, respiratory distress, delirium, alcohol withdrawal, electrolyte abnormalities, DKA and pain management. In the first few days of the rotation, residents on medicine consult rotation receive an educational session on Resident as Teacher where they brainstorm and role-play teaching to adult learners and receive peer and faculty feedback on their teaching performance. The session, developed for this curriculum, is part of a larger Resident as Teacher series. Each senior resident is then responsible for presenting one module per week to each pair of night floats, so that night float interns receive all 8 didactic sessions. EVALUATION: To determine whether modules enhance intern's medical knowledge, the change in scores between pre- and post-testing on a 16 item medical knowledge exam will be calculated and compared between intervention and control sites using paired student t tests. Interns will also report their confidence in managing acute changes in patients' medical conditions on a Likert scale. To assess the impact on resident's skill in teaching, interns will rate residents on the quality of their teaching. Finally, senior residents are asked to rate their confidence on a Likert scale in teaching interns and medical students at the beginning and end of the rotation. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Currently being piloted with the first group of night floats and residents, this curriculum is innovative in its ability to formalize the overnight clinical teaching while building teaching skill capacity of senior residents. We hypothesize that this multi-layered curriculum will increase intern's knowledge of acute care management of overnight issues and will increase their confidence in their role as night-float. In addition, we hypothesize that this series of activities will enhance residents' teaching skills and build their confidence as teachers. Downstream effects that should be measured going forward include impact on resident teaching outside the modular curriculum, patient outcomes and frequency of medical errors.","L71297550     2014-01-24 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Key reasons for the lag in utilization are the technical surgical obstacles and decreased training. Recent restrictions on residency duty hours have significantly decreased surgical experience, with the average chief resident performing 52 TVHs (SD 31) [4]. Yageshi et al showed that the performance of 25 TVHs was insufficient to document proficiency [5].

E.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that a surgery ""educational"" chief resident can develop a resident-centered, evidence-based, surgical basic/clinical science curriculum that will improve American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Two curriculums were developed by 2 surgical ""educational"" chief residents (in their final year of training), for the academic years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. The primary roles of these individuals were to design and maintain a surgical curriculum under the ongoing supervision of the program director. In 2005/2006, a baseline weekly lecture series was developed by assigning topics from multiple textbooks to members of the surgical faculty based on their respective surgical specialties. In 2006/2007, a similar approach was used; however, the lecture series was accompanied by additional activities that have been described in the literature as useful in improving ABSITE performance. These activities included recommended reading assignments, ABSITE-styled questions based on the weekly lecture topic, problem-based learning conferences, and an ABSITE remediation course. To assess the 2 approaches, conference attendance and mean ABSITE total test percent correct scores for categorical and preliminary surgical residents in their 1st through 4th postgraduate years (PGY) of training in 2005/2006 and 2nd through 5th years in 2006/2007 were followed. Subgroup analysis of conference attendance and mean ABSITE percent correct scores was performed on those participating versus those not participating in the ABSITE remediation course. A Likert survey was performed to assess our surgical curriculum in 2007. RESULTS: Twenty-five residents participated in both the 2005/2006 and the 2006/2007 surgical curriculums. Twelve residents were assigned to mandatory remediation, whereas 13 were not required to participate in remediation in 2006/2007. Conference attendance did not significantly change between 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 among remediating residents (75% vs 69%, p = 0.23) but did significantly increase among nonremediating residents (76% vs 83%, p = 0.05). Overall, mean ABSITE percent correct scores significantly increased between the 2006 and the 2007 tests (64.8% vs 71.0%, p = 0.002). In subgroup analysis, those who underwent ABSITE remediation significantly increased their ABSITE score by an average of 10.2 percentage points (p = 0.0002), whereas those not participating in the course did not significantly change their score (2.5 percentage points, p = 0.36). A Likert survey assessing this year's curriculum showed that all components of this year's curriculum were ""Somewhat useful"" to ""Very useful"" in both improving surgical knowledge base and preparing for the ABSITE. CONCLUSION: An educational chief resident designed surgical curriculum, including weekly reading assignments, weekly ABSITE-styled questions, monthly chief resident problem-based conferences, and an ABSITE remediation course, may augment a basic/clinical science lecture series and may improve ABSITE performance.","1878-7452     Gregg, Shea C     Eisenberg, Dan     Duffy, Andrew J     Longo, Walter E     Evaluation Studies     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2008 Jan-Feb;65(1):36-42. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2007.09.001.

We sought to determine the impact of a dedicated HPB service to trainee exposure over time. Methods: Five-year ACGME resident and HPB Fellowship Council case logs (7/2011-6/2016) were examined alongside administrative case data at a single high-volume center. Results: During study period, 3387 HPB operations were performed including 1523 liver, 1285 pancreas, and 579 complex biliary, with volumes increasing annually. Resident and fellow trainees logged 2884 (85%) of cases, with a ratiometric workforce of 4.5 chief residents per HPB fellow. Chief residents graduated with a mean of 20 liver/16 pancreas operations (ACGME minimum= 4 liver/3 pancreas). HPB fellows graduated with a mean of 168 liver/70 pancreas operations (AHPBA minimum = 25 liver/25 pancreas). Residents/ fellows performed 953 (53%)/840 (47%) of all traineeperformed liver operations and 742 (68%)/349 (32%) of trainee-performed pancreas operations respectively, with significantly different HPB case mix (liver versus pancreas, p<0.0001). The overall relative proportion of HPB cases performed by residents versus fellows was 59%/41%, respectively, and this was stable over time (p = NS). Conclusion: Our experience suggests that a 60/40 resident/ fellow HPB case mix allows for more than adequate exposure for both groups of trainees. Liver operations appear to be more fellow-specific than pancreas operations. This relationship should be examined by all HPB fellowships that are incorporated into general surgical training programs, and could be useful as programs need to establish an expected balance between various trainee needs.","L621997096     2018-05-09 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Despite structural differences between hospitals, generally similar and favorable reports were obtained at all sites. However, comparison of verbal responses and actual utilization of the family planning service suggests that a theoretical position held by a minority as well as scattered personal biases militate against fullest cooperation with the program.     The effect of a family planning program on the staff of 3 hospitals after 18 months experience is discussed. At the Massachusetts Mental Health Center interviews were held with each of the four services. The assistant clinical director, the chief resident, the head nurse, a psychology intern, and a cross-section of 1st and 2nd year residents were contacted. At Worcester and Westboro state hospitals all the nurses (7) who had been responsible for patients who had contact with the family planning service were interviewed. Although surface responses were all favorable, some differences emerged which reflected contrasts between the staffing patterns and patient populations. The nurses at Worcester and Westboro were relieved because they ""always worried about many of our patients, especially those who are retarded, because they are often taken advantage of."" The doctors showed the same relief that a burden was taken from their shoulders. At these hospitals staff have more patients than they can serve, and many are chronic and retarded. At the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, a university-affiliated hospital with a high staff-to-patient ratio, acceptance was more mixed. In the 2 services which required physician initiative for family planning referral, less than 50% of the fertile women left with contraceptives, while in the 2 services in which the family planning counselor was free to ask the patient if she desired to meet and only later was physician approval asked, more than 90% were discharged contracepted. The most enthusiastic supporters have been younger women on the staff; they, however, are not usually in a position of authority. The 1st year residents seemed fearful of losing control of the patient to an outsider; the 2nd year residents were able to verbalize this concern that family planning intervention would ""mess up"" the transferrence. Most residents believed routine proceeded more smoothly when referral was automatic. In 1 service the chief resident and the assistant clinical director clearly opposed referrals because: it would foster splitting the transference; it would encourage residents encountering an ""erotized transference"" to ""send the patient off in order to get more confortable;"" and contraceptive information might unnecessarily excite adolescent girls whom they were ""trying to get to settle down.""

Methods: The pattern and frequency of patient encounters during the Peking Union Medical College Hospital neurology residency program for one chief resident were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 607 new inpatients (302 males, 307 females, mean age 55.2 years) were consulted during a 6-month period of neurology residency, including emergency consultation for 208 cases (34.3%) and routine consultation for 399 cases (65.7%). The chief resident consulted an average of 24 new patients per week. Most cases were diagnosed as neurologic complications secondary to systemic disorder (362 cases, 59.6%) or induced by some iatrogenic factors (66 cases, 10.5%). The most common diagnosis for an emergency consultation was metabolic encephalopathy (92 cases, 44.2% of emergency consultation) , characterized by acute onset of cognitive and /or behavioral disorders secondary to respiration failure, renal failure or multiple organ failure. For routine consultation on general internal medicine, peripheral neuropathy (n = 69) was the most common disorder, secondary to diabetes, vasculitis, connective tissue disease and paraneoplastic conditions et al. For consultation on surgery, most cases were concerned about preoperative evaluations (n = 89) of the chronic neurologic disorders, eg, residue of stroke (n = 41) and epilepsia (n = 10) and postoperative complications (n = 46). Conclusion: This should be the first reported summary of all patients one chief resident actually consulted during neurology training in China. Consultation is an unique clinic practice and challenge to neurology residents. The patient encounter profile suggests that chief residents should be prepared for the consultation practice. Accumulation of associated data from other residencies and hospitals is necessary and can help residency directors assess and guide the residency program in practice patterns.","L41719386     2005-12-23 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

M. and Frankel, H. and Shafi, S.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Declining trauma operative experience adversely impacts learning and retention of operative skills. Current solutions, such as acute care surgery, may not provide relevant operative experience. We hypothesized that a structured skills curriculum using fresh cadavers would improve participants' self-confidence in surgical exposure of human anatomic structures for trauma. METHODS: The trauma exposure course, a single-day, 8-hour course with two trainees and one instructor per fresh cadaver, was designed by the faculty of a high-volume, urban, level I trauma center. Trainees included all trauma fellows (n = 6) and surgical chief residents (n = 12) in academic year 2007 to 2008. Using a structured, pretested curriculum, participants were trained by trauma faculty in operative exposure of 48 structures in the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities. For each exposure, participants' self-reported levels of operative confidence were measured using the operating score (OR score, 1 = not confident and 5 = highly confident) before the course (pre), immediately afterward (post), and at long-term follow-up (median, 6 months). RESULTS: Participation in the trauma exposure course resulted in a significant increase in OR scores for 44 of the 48 exposures (median scores, pre 3 vs. post 5, p < 0.0001), with no decline at long-term follow-up. Participants with less previous operative experience were most likely to benefit from the course. CONCLUSION: A structured skills curriculum using fresh cadavers improved participants' self-confidence in operative skills required for surgical exposure of human anatomic structures for trauma. This model of training may be beneficial for surgical residents and fellows, as well as practicing trauma surgeons.","1529-8809     Gunst, Mark     O'Keeffe, Terence     Hollett, Lisa     Hamill, Mark     Gentilello, Larry M     Frankel, Heidi     Shafi, Shahid     Journal Article     United States     J Trauma. 2009 Nov;67(5):1091-6. doi: 10.1097/TA.0b013e3181bc77ba.

22910152,A solution to the decreased resident exposure to open operations in the era of minimally invasive surgery and restricted duty hours may be with organ procurement and transplantation surgery,2012,1,1,J Surg Educ,1878-7452,69,5,575-9,"Gunter, J. W., 3rd and Simmons, J. D. and Mitchell, M. E. and Ahmed, N.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: The surgical resident experience regarding open surgical procedures and techniques is being significantly limited by the maturation of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and duty-hour restrictions. MIS has replaced many open procedures as the current standard of care. As MIS progresses, the surgical residents' access to open surgical techniques will become significantly limited by the lack of exposure to common open operations. METHODS: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) database was retrospectively reviewed to quantify and categorize resident experience in self-reported surgical procedures. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was retrospectively reviewed to determine the amount of organ transplants and procurements performed during the study period. Data from 1999-2000 and 2008-2009 were collected and compared. RESULTS: There were dramatic changes between the time periods regarding the transition from the open to the laparoscopic approach for multiple operations. In 2008, there were 23,276 transplanted organs and 29,077 organs procured (7990 multi-organ procurements). However, the graduating general surgery chief residents reported doing an average of 2 organ procurements and 7 organ transplantations over a 5-year period. This provides the opportunity for each graduating chief resident to perform 38 more procurements during their residency. CONCLUSION: It is imperative for surgical educators to find solutions to safely train the future general surgery residents to perform more surgical techniques in less time. One solution to this problem may lie within the field of organ transplantation and procurement. The field of organ transplantation and procurement may be an untapped resource for valuable exposure to the basic principles of open surgical techniques that are declining due to the advancement of MIS and mandated duty-hour restrictions.","1878-7452     Gunter, Joseph W 3rd     Simmons, Jon D     Mitchell, Marc E     Ahmed, Naveed     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2012 Sep-Oct;69(5):575-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2012.05.005.

C.",,eng,,,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although other specialties have examined the role of the chief resident (CR), the role and training of the emergency medicine (EM) CR has largely been undefined. METHODS: A survey was mailed to all EM CRs and their respective program directors (PD) in 124 EM residency programs. The survey consisted of questions defining demographics, duties of the typical CR, and opinions regarding the level of support and training received. Multiple choice, Likert scale (1 strong agreement, 5 strong disagreement) and short-answer responses were used. We analyzed associations between CR and PD responses using Chi-square, Student's T and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of CRs and 65% of PDs responded and were similar except for age (31 vs. 42 years; p<0.001). CR respondents were most often male, in year 3 of training and held the position for 12 months. CRs and PDs agreed that the assigned level of responsibility is appropriate (2.63 vs. 2.73, p=0.15); but CRs underestimate their influence in the residency program (1.94 vs. 2.34, p=0.002) and the emergency department (2.61 vs. 3.03, p=0.002). The majority of CRs (70%) and PDs (77%) report participating in an extramural training program, and those CRs who participated in training felt more prepared for their job duties (2.26 vs. 2.73; p=0.03). CONCLUSION: EM CRs feel they have appropriate job responsibility but believe they are less influential in program and department administration than PD respondents. Extramural training programs for incoming CRs are widely used and felt to be helpful.","1936-9018     Hafner, John W     Gardner, Joanna C     Boston, William S     Aldag, Jean C     Journal Article     United States     West J Emerg Med. 2010 May;11(2):120-5.

L. and Meile, T. and Farley, D. R.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: Endoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy has become an established approach to groin hernia. The use of a totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach allows a tension-free, preperitoneal approach with potentially less discomfort and morbidity than do classic repairs. Concerns have been raised regarding excessive cost, need for general anesthesia, and an extensive learning curve for surgeon and resident trainee alike. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 264 consecutive patients undergoing TEP for inguinal hernia repair from September 1995 to April 2000 was performed. All repairs were performed by surgical trainees under the supervision of a single staff surgeon. RESULTS: Mean age of 256 men and 8 women undergoing 386 inguinal hernia repairs was 54 years (range, 15-86). Inguinal hernias were unilateral (n = 142) or bilateral (n = 122); indirect (52%), direct (33%), or pantaloon (15%); 37 defects (10%) were recurrent. Surgical residents (n = 74) participated in all 264 operations and were considered the ""junior surgeon"" in 211 cases: 19 chief residents did 35 operations, 9 PG-4s performed 27, 8 PG-3s did 17, 10 PG-2s completed 41, and 28 interns did 91 procedures. Mean operative time was 96 minutes (range, 30-261) with no statistical difference among PG-1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, or chief residents learning the procedure. Early postoperative complications included urinary retention (n = 25), seroma (n = 3), ileus (n = 3), and subcutaneous wound infection (n = 1). Fully 24% of patients desired or required overnight admission. All patients (100%) operated on for recurrence (n = 37) or a previous contralateral repair (n = 19) favored the current TEP approach over their prior repair. Hernia recurrence has developed in 8 patients, with 6 (75%) occurring within the first 40 study patients. Mean follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 1.2-5.9 years). CONCLUSIONS: The totally extraperitoneal approach is a safe and effective method of inguinal hernia repair. Following a learning curve of 40 patients for the staff surgeon, the recurrence rate has been less than 1%, with surgical trainees safely performing TEP repairs under supervision.","Haidenberg, Jaime     Kendrick, Michael L     Meile, Tobias     Farley, David R     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2003 Jan-Feb;60(1):65-8. doi: 10.1016/S0149-7944(02)00657-8.

We sought to describe surgeon attitudes about and practices of informed consent. Methods: We recruited participants from a general surgery clinic from October 2009 to August 2010. We included all patients presenting for possible surgical management of inguinal herniorrhaphy or benign biliary disease. We also included all attending surgeons, physician assistants (PAs) and surgical residents staffing the clinic. We gave the patients portable audio recorders to capture the discussions during their clinic visit. We also recorded semi-structured telephone interviews with the provider participants that explored how they approached the process of informed consent. For each set of recordings (e.g., provider interviews and patient-provider discussions), we developed codebooks using the editing style approach to qualitative analysis, developed by Crabtree and Miller for use within medical settings. Two trained analysts independently listened to each set of recordings and coded the responses using the appropriate iteratively derived codebook. We then summarized the frequencies of codes as a proportion of the respondents and linked the codes to representative quotations. Results: We recorded the patient-provider discussions from a cohort of 73 consecutively enrolled patients. We also enrolled 15 residents, 5 chief residents, 3 physician assistants, and 2 staff surgeons. Mean Kappa across all codes was 0.96 for the provider interviews and 0.93 for the patient-provider discussions, representing what Landis and Koch describe as almost perfect agreement between the qualitative analysts (0.81-1.00). When asked what kinds information they routinely discuss during the consent process, most providers mentioned risks (100%) and benefits (95%), and slightly less mentioned alternatives (84%), surgical technique (84%), logistics of care (79%) and typical patient experience (68%). However, in the recorded patient-provider discussions, providers frequently discussed risks (92%), technique (90%) and logistics (82%), but they discussed a benefits (36%), and alternatives (54%) much less frequently. Conclusions: Most of these providers demonstrated awareness of the common legal and ethical standards for discussing risks, benefits, and alternatives during the process of informed consent. However, in practice, they focused primarily on risks and surgical technique, frequently omitting discussion of the benefits and alternatives of the procedures. Reasons for this discrepancy are unclear. Providers may be responding to patient preferences for less information, but further research is needed to determine if the discrepancy requires action, and if so, what kinds of action would most effectively support high quality informed consent.","L70973573     2013-01-25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Will a fellowship interfere with a chief resident's experience or case volume? The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the presence of an advanced laparoscopic fellow in a tertiary care hospital and residency has had no deleterious effect on chief resident laparoscopic case volume. METHODS: The operative case logs of graduating residents and fellows from 2001 to 2011 were reviewed, focusing on laparoscopic basic and complex cases and comparing between those 2 groups and comparing residents' case numbers with the national average published by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. RESULTS: Residents graduating from 2001 to 2011 (4-6 chief residents per year) performed an average of 989 +/- 76.2 laparoscopic cases per graduating chief class, with each chief averaging 207.7 +/- 10.7. The average number of laparoscopic basic cases per graduating chief year was 555.3 +/- 42.1, with each chief averaging 116.2 +/- 4.9. The average number of laparoscopic complex cases per graduating chief year was 434.4 +/- 39.2, with each chief averaging 91.5 +/- 7.2. Over the same period of time (1 or 2 fellows per year), fellows performed an average of 336 +/- 23.3 cases per year. When comparing residents' total average cases with the national data, the residents performed a similar number of cases (209.9 +/- 11.9 vs 195.0 +/- 19.5, P = .53). When comparing years when there were 2 clinical fellows vs years with 1 fellow, there was no change in the total number of laparoscopic cases per chief (224.2 vs 195.6, P = .26) and no change in the number of complex laparoscopic cases (97.1 vs 88.7, P = .63). There was a significant difference for basic laparoscopic cases, with a slight decrease when there were 2 fellows (127.8 vs 106.9, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: A laparoscopic fellowship has not had an adverse impact on the complex or basic laparoscopic case experience of surgical residents.

CONCLUSIONS: Programs are shifting resident benefits spending toward Core exam preparation resources and away from lead aprons. In addition, 24-hour attending coverage continues to spread among programs, and the fraction of programs providing face-to-face postcall readouts continues to decline. Finally, although resident perception of the job market is now improving, residents feel that the job market continues to discourage medical students from entering radiology, a fact borne out by the 2015 match results. How the upcoming change to a direct interventional radiology residency will affect medical student interest is as yet uncertain.","1878-4046     Hammer, Mark M     Shetty, Anup S     Cizman, Ziga     McWilliams, Sebastian R     Holt, Daniel K     Gould, Jennifer E     Evens, Ronald G     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 2015 Oct;22(10):1308-16. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2015.07.007.

In 2013 our residency program implemented a multifaceted resident wellness committee, in part to destigmatize mental health issues and raise awareness of local mental health resources. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the prevalence of and contributors to unmet mental health needs among pediatric residents at a medium- sized residency program. METHODS: In December of 2015 we distributed a 12-item, webbased, anonymous survey to all 78 pediatric residents at our program. The survey addressed resident interest in mental health services, prevalence of unmet mental health needs, and barriers to obtaining mental health services. RESULTS: 35% of residents completed the survey. Respondents were disproportionately female (93%) but equally distributed among residency class and relationship status. 29% of residents reported being interested in mental health services over the previous 2 weeks. Of this group, 54% did not access mental health services. The primary barriers were time, access, cost, and lack of control over one's schedule. Primary support systems included family/friends (35%), co-residents (24%), chief residents (13%), and program directors (8%). Most residents (57%) felt that a co-pay up to $30 per mental health visit was reasonable. 18% agreed that our program/hospital provided adequate mental health resources. Narrative comments identified significant stigma associated with taking time off to manage mental health problems; those in need of mental health services can be perceived as less capable than their peers. CONCLUSION: Despite the efforts of our wellness committee, a subset of residents at our program reported an unmet mental health need, primarily due to time, scheduling conflicts, lack of knowledge on how to access care, and stigma. Richer qualitative data through focus groups is needed to better understand and address these resident perceptions. National surveys of pediatric and non-pediatrics residents should be performed to identify best practices in addressing resident mental health.","L619743819     2017-12-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The IUD is greatly underused in the US, selected by only 1% of contraception users. Lack of knowledge on the part of clinicians and patients about currently available devices and inadequate clinical training in IUD insertion are major obstacles to expanded utilization of this effective method. The vast majority of chief residents in obstetrics-gynecology have never inserted an IUD or have inserted too few to be considered proficient. Many concerns are related to the Dalkon Shield's adverse effects; which concerns are not generalizable to contemporary devices. Also limiting IUD use has been the perception that the device acts as an abortifacient. Current research suggests the device induces a local inflammatory response in the endometrium. The addition of copper further decreases the likelihood of sperm reaching the distal section of the fallopian tubes and diminishes fertilization capabilities. The copper-containing IUD in use today has a low expulsion rate (3%) and low rates of removal for pain and bleeding. Perforation rates remain steady at approximately 1 per 1000-2000 insertions. Return to fertility after removal is comparable to that associated with oral contraceptives and barrier methods.     eng","Haseltine, F     Stewart, F     Case Reports     Journal Article     United States     Obstet Gynecol Surv. 1996 Dec;51(12 Suppl):S1-3.

ACST cases included biliary (19.4%), skin/soft tissue (10%), hernia (9.8%), and appendix (6.5%). Second-year residents performed a lower percentage of laparoscopic cases after the creation of the ACST (20.4% vs 26.3%; P = .003), while chief residents performed a higher percentage (42.1 vs 37.4; P = .04). Case numbers and complexity following ACST development were unchanged within all year groups (P > .1). CONCLUSION: ACST in a residency program does not sacrifice resident case complexity, diversity, or volume.","1879-1883     Hatch, Quinton     McVay, Derek     Johnson, Eric K     Maykel, Justin A     Champagne, Bradley J     Steele, Scott R     Evaluation Studies     Journal Article     United States     Am J Surg. 2014 Nov;208(5):856-859. doi: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2014.05.001.

S. and Zeleznik, C.",,eng,,,"Physicians who are excessively underconfident or overconfident about their knowledge may have impaired clinical judgement. Confidence weighting of multiple choice examinations asks test-takers to state how confident they are that the answers they selected are correct. This previously described method allows the examinee to receive 'overconfidence' and 'underconfidence' scores. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that these scores would correlate with faculty assessment of pediatric residents' confidence level as observed in the clinical setting. Thirty-three pediatric residents took an examination of general pediatric knowledge using confidence weighting method. Percentage of questions answered correctly ranged from 40 to 81%. There was an association between increasing overconfidence and lower examination scores (r = 0.58; p = 0.001). Increasing overconfidence was also associated with decreasing underconfidence (r = 0.38; p = 0.04). Five faculty members, the program director and the chief resident were asked to rate their perceptions of the residents' confidence on a Likert-type scale. The period of observation ranged from 9 months to 3 years. Linear regression demonstrated an association between underconfidence indices and observed confidence in the clinical setting (r = 0.39; p = 0.03). In addition, three of four residents who left the program had either over- or underconfidence indices greater than one standard deviation from the mean. These results indicate that the multiple choice examination with confidence weighting can predict residents who will be judged as underconfident by clinical preceptors. This finding is important in light of our impression that such house officers often have difficulties later during their residencies.","Hausman, C L     Weiss, J C     Lawrence, J S     Zeleznik, C     Journal Article     England     Med Teach. 1990;12(2):163-8.

The survey results allow individual programs to compare features of their programs with national averages and to gauge trends in radiology residency training. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to the chief residents in 180 accredited radiology residency programs in the United States. A variety of demographic and common-interest questions were asked. The 1997 survey focused on American Board of Radiology (ABR) examination preparation, residency curriculum, and socioeconomic issues relevant to graduating radiology residents. RESULTS: Completed surveys from 73 programs (41%) were returned. Areas of curriculum concern among chief residents reflected primarily current turf issues. A higher than expected percentage of residents considered their training to be inadequate in nonneurologic magnetic resonance imaging and chest, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary radiology. Job security is a major emerging concern for radiology residents who are considering careers in private practice. The practice of remembering and transcribing questions from the ABR written examination is common, and these questions are a valued resource in preparing for the diagnostic section of the written examination. Most residents attend a commercial review course before the oral examination, and the majority of programs also provide internal review courses. CONCLUSION: A higher than expected percentage of chief residents expressed concern regarding training in subspecialties of radiology that are neither areas of turf dispute nor areas where certificate of additional qualification examinations are offered. Radiology programs and residents expend substantial resources on preparation for the ABR examinations in addition to the usual 4-year curriculum. The most valued resource for the diagnostic section of the examination is almost certainly not equally available. Radiology residents are increasingly concerned about future job security.","Heck, D V     Vaughan, T E     Duncan, J R     Evens, R G     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 1998 Mar;5(3):224-31.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The club began with a presentation outlining the process that would occur in an alternating format, with topics and articles chosen by residents. In session A, questions were rephrased in a Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome format, and a literature search was performed. Articles were discussed in session B, with residents assigned by year to the tasks of article summary, technology assessment, and comparison to checklists (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, or Quality of Reporting of Meta-analysis). The residents collectively assigned a level of evidence to each article, and a scribe provided a summary. RESULTS: Twenty-two residents participated, with 12/22 (55%) of residents submitting any question, 6/22 (27.3%) submitting more than one question, and 4 residents submitting questions in more than one session. Topics included radiation risk, emergency radiology, screening examinations, modality comparisons, and technology assessment.

We quantified and determined predictive factors for resident manuscript production. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic surveys were sent to 255 chief residents and recent graduates of 83 accredited urological training programs in the United States and Canada. Survey questions pertained to manuscript submission and acceptance before and during residency, months of research incorporated into residency, PhD degree status and the pursuit of fellowship training. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 127 residents from 83 programs. The median number of manuscripts submitted and accepted during residency was 3 (range 0 to 32) and 2 (range 0 to 25), respectively. Months of protected research time and the number of publications before residency were significantly predictive of the number of manuscripts submitted during residency (p <0.001 and p <0.001, respectively). The number of manuscripts submitted during residency was significantly associated with entering fellowship training (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Manuscript preparation and publication are important aspects of the training process at a number of urological surgery residency programs. While the majority of residents are not involved in publication before residency, most submit and publish at least 1 manuscript as first author in a peer reviewed journal during residency. The number of prior publications and months of allotted research time are significantly predictive of resident manuscript productivity. In turn, manuscript submission is indicative of the decision to pursue fellowship training.","1527-3792     Hellenthal, Nicholas J     Ramirez, Michelle L     Yap, Stanley A     Kurzrock, Eric A     Journal Article     United States     J Urol. 2009 Jan;181(1):281-6; discussion 286-7. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2008.09.022.

OBJECTIVE: To increase the frequency and quality of resident peer feedback and improve residents comfort engaging in verbal feedback. METHODS: Baseline data were obtained from pediatric and internal medicine-pediatric residents at the University of Minnesota with an online survey. Chief residents implemented weekly peer feedback sessions at four inpatient pediatric sites. Time was protected and residents were instructed to share personal improvement goals and provide each other with feedback. A follow up survey was sent at 6 months. RESULTS: Response rates for the baseline and 6 month surveys were 38% and 51% (n=102) respectively. Residents participating in weekly verbal peer feedback increased from 13% to 69%. 75% of residents felt comfortable giving feedback compared to 49% at baseline, while 87% reported comfort receiving feedback compared to 77%. The percentage who felt their peer feedback was useful increased from 74 to 79%. 81% believed that peer feedback had caused a change in their practice compared to 71% at baseline. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study suggests that chief-facilitated peer feedback sessions increase the frequency of and comfort with peer feedback.

Pairing lecture-based instruction on foundational QI/PS concepts with application of those skills to real-time event analyses provides an opportunity to align institutional goals with resident education. Setting and Participants: Large, multi-site, academic Internal Medicine residency program. Fifty-two second year residents participated in the required course out of 174 total trainees. Lectures were delivered by two QI chief residents with additional faculty members as small group leaders. Description: The curriculum was delivered over one month in weekly 3-hour sessions. The first two weeks focused on patient safety tools (Root Cause Analysis, interviews with stakeholders, Process Maps and Hazard Analysis). The second two weeks emphasized the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Model for Improvement (aim statements, PDSA cycles, and metrics). Residents were divided into groups of 5 for project work that coincided with lecture material during the month. Each group was assigned a recent patient safety event that had been reported through the institution's electronic error reporting system and was preselected by instructors and institutional patient safety representatives. Priority was given to internist-submitted event reports that aligned with institutional priorities. The resident-performed event reviews and improvement suggestions were presented at the conclusion of the course to hospital QI/PS leadership. Evaluation: Knowledge evaluation was assessed using the validated QIKAT-R tool. 52 residents participated in the course and 33 completed both pre-and post-test evaluations (63% response rate). Composite scores significantly improved from pre-test (13.7) to post-test (17.4), for a 3.7 point increase (95% CI 2.3-5.1, p < 0.001). The majority of residents (71%) rated the overall course quality as Excellent or Very Good. One resident commented, I did not know any of the strategies for approaching QI before this series and practicing working through actual cases with my colleagues was a great way to learn. Another wrote, our group was able to use our specific case to identify targeted interventions that would help avoid future errors. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: Coupling traditional QI/PS didactics with actual patient safety event review aligns resident education, institutional priorities and CLER requirements. Reporting resident reviews directly to existing institutional safety leadership provides residents with meaningful work and ensures their efforts are not lost as residents disperse back to clinical rotations. Event reviews are small enough in scope to incorporate easily into resident schedules.","L622329842     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Executive safety rounds have been endorsed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as a method to connect leadership with concerns faced by frontline staff. Applying a similar model to the residency environment engages housestaff in safety culture and lowers barriers for event reporting, satisfying objectives in the CLER initiative set forth by the ACGME. Setting and Participants: Setting was an urban, county hospital that is 1 of 3 training sites for a large, academic Internal Medicine residency program. Out of 174 residents, fifteen trainees per month rotate on the inpatient general internal medicine service. Description: A quality and safety chief resident (CR) visited the resident work room on admitting days at an agreed upon time. After an introduction, the residents were asked to share something that has gone well followed by their biggest safety concerns. The conversation then opened to any specific concerns with prompts from the CR regarding unexpected deaths or ICU transfers, readmissions, hospital acquired infections, VTE events, and professionalism concerns. Field notes were recorded by CR. After rounds were done, event reports were filed by residents or CR as indicated and action items were compiled. If applicable, teams received follow up emails about their concerns. Evaluation: Participants were surveyed about their experience, and preliminary results indicate that the majority (70%) felt safety rounds increased awareness of patient safety events and made it easier to report concerns (70%). No resident felt that rounds disrupted patient care. One trainee stated safe space to debrief on how to do better for our patients. Another wrote that the rounds, helped report certain events that would have otherwise been forgotten. The most common themes based on field notes were communication/professionalism and care coordination concerns (30% and 34% of all events respectively). Medicine residents completed 25% of all physician submitted electronic event reports since implementation compared with 13% during the same period the year prior. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: Introducing safety rounds to housestaff increases awareness of patient safety topics and lowers the barriers to reporting safety concerns in a structure that minimizes workflow disruptions. It is an intervention at the point of care which allows for timely feedback and involves reporting to a trusted peer leader (CR). In particular, it provides trainees with a space to discuss unprofessional behavior which prior studies have shown are often observed but rarely reported by trainees. Loop closure and reporting themes to hospital leadership improves accountability and care transformation.","L622330873     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The survey also explored each physician's tolerance of uncertainty, knowledge of apparent life-threatening events, experience, fear of litigation, responsiveness to parental demands, and propensity to order tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presumed decisions to prescribe antibiotics and/or order home apnea monitoring in a simulated case of an infant who had experienced an apparent life-threatening event not requiring resuscitation. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis revealed 2 characteristics that made significant and independent contributions to respondents' presumed decision to prescribe antibiotics: (1) experience with an adverse outcome, and (2) propensity to order diagnostic tests. Presumed decisions to order a home apnea monitor were notably affected by fear of litigation.

Less than one-third included contact dermatitis-focused journals in journal club conferences. A bare majority of programs (57% of directors, 53% of chief residents) identified a faculty expert in contact dermatitis, with almost all experts conducting patch-test clinics and providing lectures on contact dermatitis. Seventy-five percent of experts were members of the American Contact Dermatitis Society (ACDS). Although residents in most programs (> 78%) performed patch tests to diagnose contact dermatitis, there were 14 programs in which none of their graduates performed such tests. Moreover, only 27% of programs had rotations dedicated to contact dermatitis and/or patch testing. Finally, directors and chief residents predicted that most graduates will incorporate the TRUE Test and not the more extensive or customized patch tests in their practices. CONCLUSIONS: Several opportunities for improving contact dermatitis education in residency programs were identified, including recruitment or development of more faculty experts in contact dermatitis, creation of rotations dedicated to contact dermatitis, and greater inclusion of contact dermatitis-focused journals in journal club conferences. As the principal interest group for contact dermatitis in the United States, the ACDS is the logical organization to spearhead improvement of contact dermatitis education in residency programs.","High, Whitney A     Cruz, Ponciano D Jr     Journal Article     Canada     Am J Contact Dermat. 2003 Dec;14(4):195-9.

A questionnaire was sent out to 81 neurology program directors of the medical schools and large hospitals. 72 program directors answered the questionnaires. According to the summed results, each program had an average of 37 inpatient beds, 7 teaching staffs with the neurology board certification. The program had an average of 4 residents annually, and they served as junior neurology residents for 1.8 years, and as chief residents for 1 year with 6 months of hospital consultation. 1.4 years training in the internal medicine was prerequisite for the neurology program. The training of clinical neurophysiology was done mainly by the own faculty staff in each program, but the training of neuroradiology and neuropathology varied. A quarter of the training programs had their own teaching staffs of neuroradiology and the rest of three quarters asked for training to the neuroradiology department. 32 of 72 programs had their own teaching neuropathologists and 26 programs asked the training in the pathology department and 14 programs did not have any teaching staffs of neuropathology. It seems that these numerical data are quite similar to those of the American standard of Accreditation Councils. We must still improve the real contents of the neurology training program with more capable teaching staffs.","Hirose, Genjiro     English Abstract     Journal Article     Japan     Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2002 Nov;42(11):1139-40.

C. and Idenburg, F. and Ramasamy, A. and van Egmond, T. and Leenen, L. P. and Hamming, J. F.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: To improve care for battle casualties, we analyzed the surgical workload during the Dutch deployment to Uruzgan, Afghanistan. This surgical workload was compared with the resident surgical training and the pre-deployment medical specialist program. METHODS: Patient data from the trauma registry (2006-2010) at the Dutch Role 2 Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) were analyzed. The case logs of chief residents (n = 15) from the general surgery training program in the Netherlands were used for comparison. RESULTS: The trauma registry query yielded 2,736 casualties, among whom 60 % (1,635/2,736) were classified as disease non-battle casualties and 40 % (1,101/2,736) as battle casualties. During the study period, 1,427 casualties (336 pediatric cases) required 2,319 surgical procedures. Each graduating chief resident handled an average of 1,444 cases, including 165 laparotomies, 19 major vessel repairs, 28 amputations, and 153 fracture stabilizations, during their residency. Residents had limited exposure to injuries requiring a thoracotomy, craniotomy, nephrectomy, IVC repair, or external genital trauma. CONCLUSIONS: The injuries treated at the Dutch Role 2 MTF were often severe, and exposure to pediatric cases was much higher than reported for other combat hospitals in Iraq and in Afghanistan. The current civilian resident training does not equip the trainees with the minimally required competences of a fully trained military surgeon. The recognition in the Netherlands of military surgery as a subspecialty within general (trauma) surgery, with a formal training curriculum, should be considered. The introduction of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization Military (and Disaster) Surgery standard may facilitate the achievement of this aim.","1863-9941     Hoencamp, R     Tan, E C T H     Idenburg, F     Ramasamy, A     van Egmond, T     Leenen, L P H     Hamming, J F     Journal Article     Germany     Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg. 2014 Aug;40(4):421-8. doi: 10.1007/s00068-014-0401-z.

A. and Tetrault, J.

APPROACH: In 2014, the authors developed and launched the Addiction Recovery Clinic (ARC) to address this educational gap while also providing outpatient clinical services to patients with substance use disorders. The ARC is embedded within the residency primary care practice and is staffed by three to four internal medicine residents, two board-certified addiction medicine specialists, one chief resident, and one psychologist. Residents spend one half-day per week for four consecutive weeks at the ARC seeing new and returning patients. Services provided include pharmacological and behavioral treatments for opioid, alcohol, and other substance use disorders, with direct referral to local addiction treatment facilities as needed. Visit numbers, a patient satisfaction survey, and an end-of-rotation resident evaluation were used to assess the ARC. OUTCOMES: From 2014 to 2015, 611 patient encounters occurred, representing 97 new patients. Sixty-one (63%) patients were seen for opioid use disorder. According to patient satisfaction surveys, 29 (of 31; 94%) patients reported that the ARC probably or definitely helped them to cope with their substance use. Twenty-eight residents completed the end-of-rotation evaluation; all rated the rotation highly. NEXT STEPS: The ARC offers a unique primary-care-based approach to exposing internal medicine residents to the knowledge and skills necessary to diagnose, treat, and prevent unhealthy substance use. Future research will examine other clinical and educational outcomes.","1938-808x     Holt, Stephen R     Segar, Nora     Cavallo, Dana A     Tetrault, Jeanette M     Journal Article     United States     Acad Med. 2017 May;92(5):680-683. doi: 10.1097/ACM.0000000000001480.

Systems of transfer management and transfer frequency may affect clinical outcomes. METHODS: To characterize the systems by which patient information is transferred (""signed out"") between resident physicians in internal medicine residency programs and to determine the impact of recently enacted resident work-hour regulations on the frequency of transfers, we mailed a self-administered survey to chief residents at 324 accredited US internal medicine residency programs outside of New York State. The main outcome measures were sign-out practices, skills training, and transfer frequency. RESULTS: Surveys were returned from 202 programs (62%). Transfer systems varied among and within institutions: 55% did not consistently require both a written and an oral sign-out at transfers of care, 34% left sign-out to interns alone, and 59% had no means of informing nurses that a transfer had taken place. In addition, 60% of the programs did not provide any lectures or workshops on sign-out skills. After work-hour regulations were instituted, transfers of care for a hypothetical patient increased by a mean of 11% (from 7.0 to 7.8 transfers; P<.001) during a Monday-Friday hospitalization. A member of the primary team was in the hospital for 47% of the hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Although transfers of care are increasingly frequent, few internal medicine residency programs have comprehensive transfer of care systems in place, and most do not provide formal training in sign-out skills to all residents.","Horwitz, Leora I     Krumholz, Harlan M     Green, Michael L     Huot, Stephen J     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

METHODS: Nonidentifying demographic information, career plans, and general questions about residency experience were queried. Participants were asked to rate their mentorship experience in general and specifically with regard to research, personal quality of life, and career preparation. Responses were scored using a five-point ordinal Likert scale, with higher scores representing more favorable responses. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 47 (17.2%) respondents. Eighteen respondents (38%) were assigned an official faculty mentor, and 23 respondents (49%) were assigned a research mentor during their residency. Thirty-nine respondents (83%) reported receiving meaningful mentorship from faculty who were not officially assigned mentors. Overall, 18 respondents (38%) were neutral or not satisfied with the mentorship they received during residency. Statistically significant higher scores were noted for mentorship in career preparation (median, 4) versus mentorship in research (median, 4; P < .001) and resident quality of life (median, 3; P < .001). Lower scores were noted for availability of mentorship in preparation for a career in private practice versus academic medicine (median, 4 vs. 5; P < .001). Residents who were officially assigned mentors reported statistically significant higher scores with regard to satisfaction with the overall mentorship experience (median, 4 vs. 3; P = .05) and different aspects of mentorship in career preparation and research training. CONCLUSIONS: The current study reveals variability in the mentorship experience in otolaryngology residency. Potential deficiencies may exist, including absence of formal mentorship in some residency programs.

When multiple patients infected with K. pneumoniae bacteremia at the same time, it is important to verify the cross-transmission. By using RAPD (random amplify polymorphic DNA), we could confirm whether the infection control procedures had exactly been done. Methods: In August 16th to September 7th 2014, there were four K. pneumoniae infection cases in Hematology and Oncology ward in a medical center, which were significantly increased compared to the past. By analyzing the patient area, medical team, drug usage (anticoagulant), central venous catheter usage (port-A or PICC), and susceptibility of antibiotics of infected cases, as well as RAPD technique to verify whether there were cross-transmission, these information could be the basis for infection control. Results: The four K. pneumoniae infection cases belonged to different medical teams. Moreover, the patient area, caring nurses were also different. There were no sharing of anticoagulant. However, the sensitivity tests for antibiotics were identical. Nevertheless, the RAPD showed that the bacterial isolates from the four cases were unrelated. Conclusions: The ICN intervened and reminded for hand hygiene of healthcare workers when the second cases of K. pneumoniae infection appeared. Chief residents were also been asked to assist to remind interns and other healthcare workers to follow the aseptic techniques during insertion of port-A or PICC. There were two more cases appeared however. The ICN then checked whether the anticoagulant was been shared by different patients. Yet there were no sharing of the anticoagulant. Despite the same susceptibility for four K. pneumoniae, their RAPD patterns were different. Although the outbreak showed no sign of cross-transmission, the infection control procedures were still important and needed to be followed.","L72082492     2015-11-27 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

C.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The surgical learning curve persists for years after training, yet existing continuing medical education activities targeting this are limited. We describe a pilot study of a scalable video-based intervention, providing individualized feedback on intraoperative performance. STUDY DESIGN: Four complex operations performed by surgeons of varying experience--a chief resident accompanied by the operating senior surgeon, a surgeon with less than 10 years in practice, another with 20 to 30 years in practice, and a surgeon with more than 30 years of experience--were video recorded. Video playback formed the basis of 1-hour coaching sessions with a peer-judged surgical expert. These sessions were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically coded. RESULTS: The sessions focused on operative technique--both technical aspects and decision-making. With increasing seniority, more discussion was devoted to the optimization of teaching and facilitation of the resident's technical performance. Coaching sessions with senior surgeons were peer-to-peer interactions, with each discussing his preferred approach. The coach alternated between directing the session (asking probing questions) and responding to specific questions brought by the surgeons, depending on learning style. At all experience levels, video review proved valuable in identifying episodes of failure to progress and troubleshooting alternative approaches. All agreed this tool is a powerful one. Inclusion of trainees seems most appropriate when coaching senior surgeons; it may restrict the dialogue of more junior attendings. CONCLUSIONS: Video-based coaching is an educational modality that targets intraoperative judgment, technique, and teaching. Surgeons of all levels found it highly instructive. This may provide a practical, much needed approach for continuous professional development.","1879-1190     Hu, Yue-Yung     Peyre, Sarah E     Arriaga, Alexander F     Osteen, Robert T     Corso, Katherine A     Weiser, Thomas G     Swanson, Richard S     Ashley, Stanley W     Raut, Chandrajit P     Zinner, Michael J     Gawande, Atul A     Greenberg, Caprice C     T32 DK007754-12/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States     UL1 RR025011/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States     L30CA123695-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States     2T32DK00754-12/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States     T32 DK007754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States     L30RR031458-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Am Coll Surg. 2012 Jan;214(1):115-24. doi: 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.10.009.

S. and Nagahama, Y. and Nakagawa, D. and Starke, R. M. and Dlouhy, B. J. and Torner, J. C. and Jabbour, P. and Allan, L. and Derdeyn, C. P. and Greenlee, J. D. W. and Hasan, D.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE Intracranial stenting and flow diversion require the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to prevent in-stent thrombosis. DAPT may significantly increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications in patients who require subsequent surgical interventions. In this study, the authors sought to investigate whether DAPT is a risk factor for hemorrhagic complications associated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Moreover, the authors sought to compare VP shunt complication rates with respect to the shunt's location from the initial external ventricular drain (EVD) site. METHODS Patients with aSAH who presented to the authors' institution from July 2009 through November 2016 and required VP shunt placement for persistent hydrocephalus were included. The rates of hemorrhagic complications associated with VP shunt placement were compared between patients who were on a regimen of DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel) for use of a stent or flow diverter, and patients who underwent microsurgical clipping or coiling only and were not on DAPT using a backward stepwise multivariate analysis. Rates of radiographic hemorrhage and infection-related VP shunt revision were compared between patients who underwent VP shunt placement along the same track and those who underwent VP shunt placement at a different site (contralateral or posterior) from the initial EVD. RESULTS A total of 443 patients were admitted for the management of aSAH. Eighty of these patients eventually required VP shunt placement. Thirty-two patients (40%) had been treated with stent-assisted coiling or flow diverters and required DAPT, whereas 48 patients (60%) had been treated with coiling without stents or surgical clipping and were not on DAPT at the time of VP shunt placement. A total of 8 cases (10%) of new hemorrhage were observed along the intracranial proximal catheter of the VP shunt. Seven of these hemorrhages were observed in patients on DAPT, and 1 occurred in a patient not on DAPT. After multivariate analysis, only DAPT was significantly associated with hemorrhage (OR 31.23, 95% CI 2.98-327.32; p = 0.0001). One patient (3%) on DAPT who experienced hemorrhage required shunt revision for hemorrhage-associated proximal catheter blockage. The remaining 7 hemorrhages were clinically insignificant. The difference in rates of hemorrhage between shunt placement along the same track and placement at a different site of 0.07 was not significant (6/47 vs 2/32, p = 0.46). The difference in infection-related VP shunt revision rate was not significantly different (1/47 vs 3/32, p = 0.2978). CONCLUSIONS This clinical series confirms that, in patients with ruptured aneurysms who are candidates for stent-assisted coiling or flow diversion, the risk of clinically significant VP shunt-associated hemorrhage with DAPT is low. In an era of evolving endovascular therapeutics, stenting or flow diversion is a viable option in select aSAH patients.","1933-0693     Hudson, Joseph S     Nagahama, Yasunori     Nakagawa, Daichi     Starke, Robert M     Dlouhy, Brian J     Torner, James C     Jabbour, Pascal     Allan, Lauren     Derdeyn, Colin P     Greenlee, Jeremy D W     Hasan, David     Journal Article     United States     J Neurosurg. 2017 Nov 10:1-6. doi: 10.3171/2017.5.JNS17642.

S. and Wu, C. and Bentz, M. L. and Redett, R. J. and Shack, R. B. and David, L. R. and Taub, P. J. and Janis, J. E.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: Resident aesthetic clinics (RACs) have demonstrated good outcomes and acceptable patient satisfaction, but few studies have evaluated their educational, financial, or medicolegal components. We sought to determine RAC best practices. METHODS: We surveyed American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeon members (n = 399), focusing on operational details, resident supervision, patient safety, medicolegal history, financial viability, and research opportunities. Of the 96 respondents, 63 reported having a RAC, and 56% of plastic surgery residency program directors responded. RESULTS: RACs averaged 243 patient encounters and 53.9 procedures annually, having been in existence for 19.6 years (mean). Full-time faculty (73%) supervised chief residents (84%) in all aspects of care (65%). Of the 63 RACs, 45 were accredited, 40 had licensed procedural suites, 28 had inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 31 used anesthesiologists. Seventeen had overnight capability, and 17 had a Life Safety Plan. No cases of malignant hyperthermia occurred, but 1 facility death was reported. Sixteen RACs had been involved in a lawsuit, and 33 respondents reported financial viability of the RACs. Net revenue was transferred to both the residents' educational fund (41%) and divisional/departmental overhead (37%). Quality measures included case logs (78%), morbidity/mortality conference (62%), resident surveys (52%), and patient satisfaction scores (46%). Of 63 respondents, 14 have presented or published RAC-specific research; 80 of 96 of those who were surveyed believed RACs enhanced education. CONCLUSIONS: RACs are an important component of plastic surgery education. Most clinics are financially viable but carry high malpractice risk and consume significant resources. Best practices, to maximize patient safety and optimize resident education, include use of accredited procedural rooms and direct faculty supervision of all components of care.","Hultman, C Scott     Wu, Cindy     Bentz, Michael L     Redett, Richard J     Shack, R Bruce     David, Lisa R     Taub, Peter J     Janis, Jeffrey E     Journal Article     United States     Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open. 2015 Jul 4;3(3):e370. doi: 10.1097/01.GOX.0000464864.49568.18. eCollection 2015 Mar.

Results: The number of open PGV performed by any one resident ranged form 4 to 16; Seventy percent (70%) of Chief Residents never performed a PGV during their training. For Laparoscopic PGV there has been an increase from zero in 1992 to 328 in 1999. When the absolute number of cases per resident is considered it continues to be under 1.0.

H.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: Most general surgery residents obtain scant exposure to anorectal disease during training. The aim of this study was to determine whether adding a colon and rectal surgeon to the faculty of a general surgery training program improves the amount or quality of the anorectal surgical experience. METHODS: The surgical experience of all graduating residents from our university teaching program was reviewed during a ten-year period. Complete case data were obtained from the Residency Review Committee for surgery. The total small-intestine, colon and anorectal caseload was analyzed during the five-year period preceding the arrival of the colon and rectal surgeon and compared with the subsequent five-year period after the surgeon's arrival. RESULTS: There was a substantial increase in small-intestine (470 vs. 306) and anorectal cases (462 vs. 338). There was a particularly dramatic increase in anorectal cases performed during the chief resident year (159 vs. 36), which held true for all categories of anorectal cases. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a full-time colon and rectal surgeon to a university general surgery residency program was associated with an increase in small-intestine and especially anorectal cases. However, most striking was the greater than fourfold increase in the number of anorectal cases performed during the chief resident year. This seems to reflect an increase in complexity of anorectal cases and an increased interest in anorectal surgery among general surgery residents.","Hyman, N H     Journal Article     United States     Dis Colon Rectum. 1999 Feb;42(2):249-51.

The intern was outraged and the author's first response was to laugh, then to worry for the intern and finally recognize that she is finally safe from the hurt of those words. When the author was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at the end of her first semester, she felt like a deer caught in the headlights. During her third year medicine clerkship, the author would look up from writing notes on patients to find the chief resident peering around the corner at her. During her surgery clerkship in the operating room, an attending surgeon told the author that she had no right to become a doctor and lacked the primary quality required in a physician. During the fourth and final year, the author's internship advisor told me that the deans had discussed her case. They had decided to pass the hat to department of medicine chairs at the Harvard teaching hospitals to get donations for a salary and thought of offering a position to the author but it would not be board eligible.

Participation in resident aesthetic surgery clinics has become an important tool to achieve this goal. Yet, there is little literature on the current structure of these clinics. Objectives: The authors sought to evaluate current practices of aesthetic resident-run clinics in the United States. Methods: A survey examining specific aspects of chief resident clinics was distributed to 70 plastic surgery resident program directors in the United States. Thirty-five questions sought to delineate clinic structure, procedures and services offered, financial cost to the patient, and satisfaction and educational benefit derived from the experience. Results: Fifty-two questionnaires were returned, representing 74.2% of programs surveyed. Thirty-two (63%) reported having a dedicated resident aesthetic surgery clinic at their institution. The most common procedures performed were abdominoplasty (n = 20), breast augmentation (n = 19), and liposuction (n = 16). Most clinics offered neuromodulators (n = 29) and injectable fillers (n = 29). The most common billing method used was a 50% discount on surgeon fee, with the patient being responsible for the entirety of hospital and anesthesia fees. Twenty-six respondents reported feeling satisfied or very satisfied with their resident aesthetic clinic. Conclusions: The authors found aesthetic chief resident clinics to differ greatly in their structure. Yet the variety of procedures and services offered makes participation in these clinics an effective training method for the development of both aesthetic surgical technique and resident autonomy.","1527-330x     Ingargiola, Michael J     Molina Burbano, Felipe     Yao, Amy     Motakef, Saba     Sanati-Mehrizy, Paymon     Burish, Nikki M     David, Lisa R     Taub, Peter J     Journal Article     England     Aesthet Surg J. 2018 Jun 13;38(7):793-799. doi: 10.1093/asj/sjy065.

22986545,Plastic surgery training: evaluating patient satisfaction with facial fillers in a resident clinic,2012,1,1,Aesthetic Plast Surg,0364-216X (Print) 0364-216x,36,6,1361-6,"Iorio, M. L. and Stolle, E. and Brown, B. J. and Christian, C. B. and Baker, S. B.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Resident cosmetic surgery clinics, or ""chief clinics,"" are arguably the most effective way to provide cosmetic surgery training. Approximately 70 % of plastic surgery training programs utilize a ""chief resident clinic"" to augment their cosmetic surgery experience, even though a quantitative outcome scale is lacking to guide education. We report the use of the FACE-Q, a novel patient outcome tool, to evaluate patients' satisfaction with nonsurgical facial rejuvenation performed by residents. METHODS: The FACE-Q ""Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall Scale"" was administered to patients prior to and 1 week after undergoing nonsurgical facial rejuvenation performed by plastic surgery residents. All patients received nonsurgical facial rejuvenation with botulinum toxin A and hyaluronic acid as part of resident facial aesthetics training. RESULTS: Eleven patients completed the pre- and postinjection FACE-Q survey. Average overall facial appearance satisfaction scores of 47.6 pre- and 51.1 postinjection were found (p < 0.037), with a total possible score of 68. Ten patients (91 %) reported feeling satisfied or very satisfied with the overall appearance of their face following injection. CONCLUSION: Despite resident inexperience and patient awareness that novices were performing the procedures, our experience supports use of the FACE-Q to optimize and endorse resident cosmetic surgery clinics. The learning curve for facial cosmetic procedures can be adversely affected by limited time available or exposure to improvement variables when initially performing the procedure. It is imperative to any technique that direct, and preferably quantitative, feedback is given so that an immediate modification can be generated and successive patient outcomes improved.

Invoking principles of credibility, continuity, and inclusion, and the establishment of two roles, as legislative and representative leader, this article offers a model for how a residency program can empower its chief resident to act decisively, make meaningful contributions to training, and ultimately enhance his or her effectiveness. METHOD: The authors review the literature on the psychiatry chief resident and identify ambiguity as a common and powerful impediment to effective leadership. RESULTS: The authors present a model for psychiatry residency programs to enhance chief resident effectiveness based on the three components of credibility, continuity, and inclusion, and elucidate how each improves chief resident leadership. The authors identify two integral leadership roles of the chief resident, those of the legislative and representative leader, and discuss how each empowers the chief resident to act decisively. CONCLUSIONS: The authors assert that if psychiatry residency programs elect the chief resident by involving both faculty and residents, grant a year-long term and include him or her in all major decisions that involve the residency, the chief resident is far more likely to make meaningful contributions to the training program.","Ivany, Christopher G     Hurt, Peyton H     Journal Article     United States     Acad Psychiatry. 2007 Jul-Aug;31(4):277-80. doi: 10.1176/appi.ap.31.4.277.

METHODS: In 2003, the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology (ARRO) conducted two nationwide surveys: one of all U.S. radiation oncology residents and one of chief residents. RESULTS: The Chief Residents' Survey was completed by representatives from all 77 programs (response rate, 100%). The Residents' Survey was returned by 229 respondents (response rate, 44%). In each, 32% of respondents were female. The most popular career after residency was private practice (46%), followed by permanent academic practice (28%). Changes that would entice those choosing private practice to consider an academic career included more research experience as a resident (76%), higher likelihood of tenure (69%), lesser time commitment (66%), and higher salary (54%). Although the majority of respondents were satisfied with educational experience overall, a number of programs were reported to provide fewer resources than required. CONCLUSIONS: Median program resources and numbers of outliers are documented to allow residents and program directors to assess the relative adequacy of experience in their own programs. Policy-making bodies and individual programs should consider these results when developing interventions to improve educational experiences of residents and to increase retention of radiation oncologists in academic practice.","Jagsi, Reshma     Buck, David A     Singh, Anurag K     Engleman, Mark     Thakkar, Vipul     Frank, Steven J     Flynn, Daniel     Journal Article     United States     Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Mar 1;61(3):642-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2004.07.690.

The program directors perceived the most important duties of the chief resident to be: act as a liaison between faculty and the residents, act as a role model, do scheduling, build teamwork and give constructive feedback. The most important skills were considered to be leadership and stress management. Causes of concern were time pressure, abuse of power, stress and work overload. Opportunities to develop leadership and administrative/management skills were considered the most exciting aspects of the position.

Consequently, there may be substantial variability in computed tomography (CT) scans desired by emergency medicine physicians, surgical chief residents, and attending trauma surgeons. We quantified this difference and studied the effects of each group's decisions on missed injuries, cost, and radiation exposure. METHODS: All blunt trauma activations at an urban level 1 trauma center were studied over a 6-mo period. Three months into the study, a pan-scan protocol was introduced. Prior to CT imaging, providers separately completed a survey that asked which CT scans were desired for each patient. Based on the completed surveys, hypothetical missed injuries, radiation exposure, and cost were determined. RESULTS: The variability in the number of CT scans desired by each of the three providers and the resulting cost and radiation exposure were not statistically significant. Substantial variability was predominantly seen in the indications for the desired scans, with the difference between proportions ranging from 3.1%-68.7%. Agreement among the three providers was highest for head and c-spine scans (80%-100%) and lowest for maxillary face (57%-80%) and chest scans (52%-74%). Overall, the missed injury rate was similar for all the providers; chief residents missed significantly more major injuries than trauma attendings during the pan-scan period (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Trauma training and level of training did not have a substantial effect on radiological decisions during the initial trauma assessment. This study sheds light on the growing uniformity among providers with regard to medical decision-making in the initial work-up of trauma.","1095-8673     James, Melissa K     Lee, Shi-Wen     Minneman, Jennifer A     Moore, Maureen D     Klein, Taylor R     Robitsek, R Jonathan     Barie, Phillip S     Schubl, Sebastian D     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Res. 2017 Jun 1;213:6-15. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2017.02.015.

T. and O'Heron, C. T. and Kallies, K. J. and Cogbill, T. H.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Providing opportunities for autonomy to enhance the development of independence and confidence during surgery residency remains among the greatest challenges of the current training paradigm. The objective of this study was to evaluate the implementation and outcomes of a chief resident service (CRS). DESIGN: A CRS was designed with operative, call and office responsibilities. Supervision and evaluation were consistent with institutional guidelines. CRS operative logs from 2011 to 2014 were compared with logs from the participants' first year in practice. Select procedures were compared and evaluations were reviewed. Residency graduates' satisfaction with the CRS was evaluated. SETTING: Independent academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Nine general surgery residency graduates with one complete year in practice. RESULTS: Nine residents completed CRS rotations and submitted case logs. Median total case volume was 1101 (994-1311) during the 5-year residency, 92 (20-149) during CRS and 299 (99-784) during the first year in practice. Median case volumes for selected procedures for the entire 5-year residency, CRS, and first year of practice were: 93 (66-97), 7 (3-16), and 9 (1-26) laparoscopic appendectomies; 146 (120-157), 24 (3-32), and 34 (15-112) laparoscopic cholecystectomies; 81 (51-94), 1 (1-4), and 3 (0-8) ileocolectomies; 57 (35-86), 4 (0-9), and 8 (2-34) ventral/incisional hernia repairs; 102 (87-137), 12 (3-16), and 13 (3-86) inguinal hernia repairs. Graduates reported that the CRS experience was very beneficial to their current practice. Annual program reviews emphasized the CRS as a major strength of our residency. CONCLUSIONS: Creation of a CRS to increase resident autonomy and provide continuity of patient care with appropriate faculty supervision was successful. Case mix and volumes provided an opportunity for independent operative and clinical experience during residency which realistically paralleled graduates' first year of practice.","1878-7452     Jarman, Benjamin T     O'Heron, Colette T     Kallies, Kara J     Cogbill, Thomas H     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2018 Jul - Aug;75(4):888-894. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.12.012.

We conducted a 10-year retrospective study of blunt spleen and liver injuries at a state-designated Level I trauma center and a survey of chief residents' operative experience with splenic and hepatic injuries from blunt trauma during the same time period. From 1990 through 1999, 431 patients were admitted with splenic injuries and 634 patients were admitted with liver injuries; 350 splenic injuries (81%) were due to blunt trauma; 317 liver injuries (50%) were caused by blunt mechanisms. In 1990 100 per cent of patients with splenic injuries and 93 per cent of those with liver injuries underwent surgery for those injuries. These rates were 19 and 28 per cent respectively in 1999. The number of patients with blunt solid visceral injuries increased more than fourfold from 1990 through 1999. The number of operations for splenic and hepatic injuries performed by chief residents did not decline significantly during this time period (5.5 cases per chief resident in 1990; 4.6 cases per chief resident in 1999). The increased numbers of patients with solid visceral injuries were due to two factors: increased proportion of blunt trauma admissions especially from motor vehicle collisions and improved recognition of spleen and liver injuries by expanded use of CT scans. We conclude that nonoperative management of blunt solid visceral injuries does not necessarily lead to a diminution of operations nor jeopardize resident education. However, trauma volumes must be high enough to support adequate operative experience.","Jennings, G R     Poole, G V     Yates, N L     Johnson, R K     Brock, M     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Am Surg. 2001 Jun;67(6):597-600.

Typically pulmonary embolism is under-diagnosed or over-diagnosed. As a chief resident in department of Gastroenterology, during the daily or emergency consultation, we found 2 patients with PE who presented with gastrointestinal manifestation initially. Both patients were with advanced stage of tumors, who received chemical therapy and short period of anti-coagulation drugs in department of oncology and orthopedics respectively. They claimed suddenly onset of upper abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting. ECG showed ST-T elevation in anterior precordial leads with fluctuation of blood pressure. Importantly, both patients had abnormal breathe rhythm without specific location of abdominal tenderness. Their doctors ascribed the symptoms to the abdominal distension. Not as usual, we suggested blood gas analysis immediately. The results showed extremely lower oxygen saturation and pressure. Eventually, pulmonary embolism with consolidation was confirmed by spiral chest CT scan. These underlined the fact that while various other common causes may exist for upper abdominal pain, one should always consider pulmonary embolism as a possible cause especially when backed up with ECG finding and breathe rhythm.","L71763920     2015-02-03 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

E. and Clowes, A. W. and Kazmers, A.",,eng,,,"During the last decade (1980 to 1989) 186 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were admitted to a single urban hospital. Ninety-six percent of these patients had a prehospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Management included paramedic field resuscitation and transport, an emergency department diagnostic protocol completed in an average of 12 minutes, rapid transport to a dedicated emergency operating room, aneurysmorrhaphy by general surgery chief residents under the supervision of specialist vascular surgeons, and skilled postoperative intensive care unit care. Nevertheless, 130 (70%) patients died in the first 30 postoperative days--3% in the emergency department, 13% in the operating room, 51% in the intensive care unit, and 3% on the ward or at home. Certain features--age greater than 80 years, female gender, persistent preoperative hypotension despite aggressive crystalloid and blood replacement, admission hematocrit less than 25, transfusion requirements exceeding 15 units--were associated with a greater than 90% likelihood of death. No patient with preoperative cardiac arrest survived more than 24 hours. From this experience we conclude that, although ""optimal"" prehospital, emergency department, operating room, and postoperative care can improve the outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in shock, most such patients will die. Certain clinical features predict such excessive mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that withholding operation may be reasonable.

W. and McNeal-Trice, K.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L623224156,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Morning report is a commonly used venue to utilize clinical cases for teaching core pediatric topics. Given the competing demands of residency training, as the academic year progresses, active resident participation in morning report can be difficult to sustain. We hypothesized that interactive, competitive and team-based activities would increase resident engagement and participation in our morning conferences series. OBJECTIVE: Introduce interactive teaching modalities to improve resident engagement, participation, learning and satisfaction at morning report conferences. METHODS: We developed interactive learning activities to integrate into the traditional format of our morning reports. Following a resident's presentation of a clinical case, the chief resident would lead a learning activity. Among others, these included Pick 5, a detective style approach to diagnosis; Matching an image and fact matching activity highlighting high yield board review topics; and Charades Race, a fast-paced race to identify pictures and buzz words. All activities were designed to be competitive with teams of mixed learner levels participating. Activities were followed by a brief didactic session with learning points from the case. A web-based survey was used to evaluate the efficacy this curriculum. RESULTS: Residents overall reacted very positively to the activities, with favorable evaluations at both three and six months interval. At six months, in comparison to traditional morning report format, 85% of residents surveyed report they participate more with the new activities; 85% report more engagement; 77% reported higher knowledge acquisition; and 77% report more satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Team-based and competitive learning activities easily integrated into a traditional morning report format. These activities emphasized active learning and created opportunities for residents to teach in the small groups. Residents report improved satisfaction, engagement, participation and learning. These activities could be adapted for use at other residency programs that have clinical case-based conferences.","L623224156     2018-07-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: The survey was sent to representatives from 240 of 256 ACGMEaccredited Ob/Gyn residencies. Patients: Residency program directors, obstetric simulation faculty, gynecologic simulation faculty, and chief residents. Intervention: An anonymous survey was distributed online to assess the availability of simulation teaching and training tools among Ob/Gyn residency programs in the US. The survey included a needs assessment component, allowing programs to identify simulation training needs for specific procedures or modes of surgery. Measurements and Main Results: Of 328 faculty sent surveys, 207 (63.1%) responded, while 12 out of 200 chief residents (6%) responded. Among faculty respondents, 92 (44.4%) were residency program directors, 68 (32.9%) gyn simulation teaching faculty, and 73 (35.3%) Ob simulation teaching faculty. Of all simulation resources, access to gyn simulation teaching (93.0%), (Table presented) simulation training tools (88.4%), dedicated time (83.6%), simulation lab (80.5%), and simulation teaching faculty (61.7%) were most available, whereas FLS certification (24.0%) and MIGS division (42.6%) were least available. Both faculty and trainees reported laparotomy and vaginal surgery as the two modes of incision needing more simulation training, while laparoscopy and hysteroscopy simulation training were most commonly available. Table 1 lists reported simulation training needs and availability for specific modes of surgery. The majority of faculty reported residents were ready to perform laparotomies, laparoscopies, and hysteroscopies independently by their third year, but not vaginal surgery or robotic surgery. Table 2 presents the cumulative percentage for when faculty respondents feel the average trainee is ready to perform procedures independently. Conclusion: The majority of Ob/Gyn training programs report residents have access to simulation training resources such as simulation curricula, teaching faculty, training tools and simulation labs.

M. and Rupp, C. C.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has recently emerged as an option for selected patients undergoing gallbladder removal. While SILC appears safe when performed by experienced surgeons under controlled conditions, there are no studies evaluating the SILC learning curve for incorporation into resident education and the effect on OR efficiency. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Chief residents were taught and evaluated by a single attending surgeon facile with SILC techniques. Residents were transitioned from assistants to primary surgeon during their clinical rotation. Outcomes data were prospectively tabulated compared with data from standard laparoscopic SLC and attending surgeon SILC outcomes. The setting was an academic, tertiary care teaching hospital. Participants were chief residents rotating on hepatobiliary surgery service. Residents previously had demonstrated mastery of basic laparoscopic surgical techniques. RESULTS: Seven chief residents were evaluated with a total of 49 SILCs with a mean of 7 (range 5-12) SILCS/resident. Five conversions to SLC occurred, all within the first 3 SILCs performed by the resident as operative surgeon. Mean blood loss was 30 mL. Median length of stay was <1 day. Average length of operation increased after the first 2 cases, reflecting the transition of the attending surgeon from primary surgeon to assistant role. By the fifth case, operative times returned to the attending surgeon SILC baseline and historical operative times for SLC at our institution. Factors associated with longer-length of surgery were increasing BMI and presence of acute or chronic cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and use of intraoperative cholangiogram. Five postoperative complications occurred and were not associated with position along the resident's learning curve. One death occurred due to metastatic laryngeal cancer within 30 days of SILC. CONCLUSIONS: Residents can safely be taught the techniques of SILC with minimal disruption to operating room efficiency. Residents already proficient in the use of standard laparoscopic techniques transition to SILC quickly with a short learning curve and proper instruction.","1878-7452     Joseph, Mark     Phillips, Michael     Farrell, Timothy M     Rupp, Christopher C     Comparative Study     Evaluation Studies     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2012 Jul-Aug;69(4):468-72. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2012.03.006.

It is unclear whether IAMCs offer qualitatively or quantitatively different operative experiences than the national cohort. We analyzed a large representative sample of IAMCs to compare operative volume and variety, with a focus on low-volume procedures. METHODS: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Program Case Reports from 27 IAMCs were collected and analyzed for 3 academic years (2012-2015). IAMCs were compared to the national cohort for specific defined category volumes and selected low-volume cases. One-sample two-way t-tests were calculated comparing IAMC totals to national program averages. RESULTS: IAMCs had a median of 3 chief residents per year (range: 1-6). IAMCs reported significantly more ""total major"" procedures in 2013-2014 (p = 0.046). Other case totals were statistically similar between IAMCs and the national cohort for ""total major"", ""surgeon chief"", ""surgeon junior"", and ""teaching assistant"" cases. In 2013-2014, IAMCs reported more laparoscopic complex (138.3 vs. 110.6, p = 0.010) and alimentary tract cases (276.5 vs. 253.5, p = 0.019). IAMC esophagogastroduodenoscopy case totals were higher in 2013-2014 (55.9 vs. 41, p = 0.038) and 2014-2015 (47.8 vs. 41, p = 0.047). IAMCs had fewer pancreas cases than the national cohort in all three years by about three cases per resident (p </= 0.026). In 2012-2013 IAMCs reported fewer (by about one) esophagectomy, gastrectomy, and abdominal perineal resections. No differences were observed in the following selected procedures: open common bile duct exploration, inguinal hernia, laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The IAMCs studied appear to provide equivalent exposure to specific subcategories mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and American Board of Surgery. Graduates of IAMCs gain similar operative experience in low-volume, defined categories when compared to the national cohort. Certain specific cases subject to regionalization pressure are less well represented among IAMCs. This has important implications for medical students applying to surgery residency.","1878-7452     Joshi, Amit R T     Trickey, Amber W     Jarman, Benjamin T     Kallies, Kara J     Josloff, Robert     Dort, Jonathan M     Kothuru, Ravi     Comparative Study     Journal Article     Multicenter Study     United States     J Surg Educ. 2017 Nov - Dec;74(6):e88-e94. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.05.020.

P.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Many residents supplement general surgery training with years of dedicated research, and an increasing number at our institution pursue additional degrees. We sought to determine whether it was worth the financial cost for residency programs to support degrees. DESIGN: We reviewed graduating chief residents (n = 69) in general surgery at Vanderbilt University from 2001 to 2010 and collected the data including research time and additional degrees obtained. We then compared this information with the following parameters: (1) total papers, (2) first-author papers, (3) Journal Citation Reports impact factors of journals in which papers were published, and (4) first job after residency or fellowship training. SETTING: The general surgery resident training program at Vanderbilt University is an academic program, approved to finish training 7 chief residents yearly during the time period studied. PARTICIPANTS: Chief residents in general surgery at Vanderbilt who finished their training 2001 through 2010. RESULTS: We found that completion of a degree during residency was significantly associated with more total and first-author publications as compared with those by residents with only dedicated research time (p = 0.001 and p = 0.017). Residents completing a degree also produced publications of a higher caliber and level of authorship as determined by an adjusted resident impact factor score as compared with those by residents with laboratory research time only (p = 0.005). Degree completion also was significantly correlated with a first job in academia if compared to those with dedicated research time only (p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the utility of degree completion when economically feasible and use of dedicated research time as an effective way to significantly increase research productivity and retain graduates in academic surgery. Aggregating data from other academic surgery programs would allow us to further determine association of funding of additional degrees as a means to encourage academic productivity and retention.","1878-7452     Joshua Smith, Jesse     Patel, Ravi K     Chen, Xi     Tarpley, Margaret J     Terhune, Kyla P     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2014 Jul-Aug;71(4):486-91. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2014.01.018.

OBJECTIVE: To understand and enhance the near-peer teaching and learning interactions of pediatric residents and fellows. METHODS: Pediatric chief residents at The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) asked pediatric level 1-3 residents to name via an anonymous web-based survey those pediatric subspecialty fellows at CHOP who were particularly effective teachers and to describe behaviors that contributed to their effectiveness. Four fellows identified by the residents as particularly effective teachers were asked to lead a panel discussion attended by residents and fellows on their use of explicit teaching strategies when interacting with residents in clinical settings. Panelists used themes from the survey to structure the discussion. Two chief residents and one faculty independently recorded key strategies for effective resident-fellow teaching discussed during the session. RESULTS: Fifteen of 138 residents completed the survey. Of the 18 fellows identified by resident responders as particularly effective teachers, the four fellows who were named by at least two residents led the one-hour panel discussion attended by 12 residents and fellows and 1 faculty. Strategies for effective resident-fellow teaching interactions emerging from the survey and discussion were condensed into a Ten Tips bullet list of actionable pearls. The list was distributed by email to residents, fellows, program directors and division chiefs and was posted in resident and fellow work rooms. DISCUSSION: Ten Tips for Fellows Teaching Residents provides a concise list of actionable strategies perceived by pediatric residents and fellows at one institution to enhance the near-peer teaching and learning experience. The Ten Tips handout will be included in the orientation packets for incoming residents and fellows, and an annual panel discussion on resident-fellow interaction will be added to the institutions core seminar series for fellows.","L619744025     2017-12-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

A. and Nath, B. and Barnes, K. and Kent, T. S.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Recent surgical education literature has focused on means of improving structured educational experience in residency, particularly in the context of limited working hours. In addition, prior studies have illustrated a void in training regarding leadership. Learning teams have been adopted in several medical schools with an aim to improve the educational experience. We instituted resident learning teams with a goal of improving resident education. DESIGN: In the 2015 to 2016 academic year, we implemented a team-based learning (TBL) system of 5 teams each led by 1 to 2 chief residents and containing an approximately equal number of residents from postgraduate year (PGY)1-4. The learning teams competed for points based on weekly quizzes, preparation of materials for resident teaching, and American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam (ABSITE) scores. After a full year of TBL, residents were surveyed on their view of the learning teams with respect to the educational experience in the residency with a series of Likert-type questions. Median ABSITE scores of categorical interns were compared between the 3 years after the implementation of the learning teams and the 4years prior with a Mann-Whitney U test. SETTING: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA; Tertiary Care Center. PARTICIPANTS: All residents from 2011 to 2018. RESULTS: After TBL implementation, median ABSITE percentile scores of PGY2-5 residents increased (35-44, p=0.04). PGY1 scores were not significantly changed. After TBL implementation, a majority of residents agreed or strongly agreed that they studied more consistently, felt more prepared for the ABSITE, were more prepared for resident school, learned more in resident school, and that the learning teams improved the educational experience of the residency. CONCLUSIONS: Learning teams subjectively improved the educational experience in our residency and engaged residents in studying and participating. In addition, PGY2-5 ABSITE scores were significantly improved. Learning teams are a program that can be easily adopted by surgical residencies elsewhere.","1878-7452     Kamine, Tovy Haber     Sabe, Ashraf A     Nath, Bharath     Barnes, Kelly     Kent, Tara S     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2018 Jun 18. pii: S1931-7204(18)30220-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2018.05.008.

B. and Rojnica, M. and Benjamin, A. J. and Schindler, N. and Posner, M. C. and Matthews, J. B. and Roggin, K. K.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: To simulate the duties and responsibilities of an attending surgeon and allow senior residents more intraoperative and perioperative autonomy, our program created a new resident acute care surgery consult service. METHODS: We structured resident acute care surgery as a new admitting and inpatient consult service managed by chief and senior residents with attending supervision. When appropriate, the chief resident served as a teaching assistant in the operation. Outcomes were recorded prospectively and reviewed at weekly quality improvement conferences. The following information was collected: (1) teaching assistant case logs for senior residents preimplentation (n = 10) and postimplementation (n = 5) of the resident acute care surgery service; (2) data on the proportion of each case performed independently by residents; (3) resident evaluations of the resident acute care surgery versus other general operative services; (4) consult time for the first 12 months of the service (June 2014 to June 2015). RESULTS: During the first year after implementation, the number of total teaching assistant cases logged among graduating chief residents increased from a mean of 13.4 +/- 13.0 (range 4-44) for preresident acute care surgery residents to 30.8 +/- 8.8 (range 27-36) for postresident acute care surgery residents (P < .01). Of 323 operative cases, the residents performed an average of 82% of the case independently. There was a significant increase in the satisfaction with the variety of cases (mean 5.08 vs 4.52, P < .01 on a 6-point Likert scale) and complexity of cases (mean 5.35 vs 4.94, P < .01) on service evaluations of resident acute care surgery (n = 27) in comparison with other general operative services (n = 127). In addition, creation of a 1-team consult service resulted in a more streamlined consult process with average consult time of 22 minutes for operative consults and 25 minutes for nonoperative consults (range 5-90 minutes). CONCLUSION: The implementation of a resident acute care surgery service has increased resident autonomy, teaching assistant cases, and satisfaction with operative case variety, as well as the efficiency of operative consultation at our institution.","1532-7361     Kantor, Olga     Schneider, Andrew B     Rojnica, Marko     Benjamin, Andrew J     Schindler, Nancy     Posner, Mitchell C     Matthews, Jeffrey B     Roggin, Kevin K     Journal Article     United States     Surgery. 2017 Mar;161(3):876-883. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2016.09.033.

R. and Celio, A. C. and Trakimas, L. and Manwaring, M. L. and Spaniolas, K.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Surgical trainee association with operative outcomes is controversial. Studies are conflicting, possibly due to insufficient control of confounding variables such as operative time, case complexity, and heterogeneous patient populations. As operative complications worsen long-term outcomes in oncologic patients, understanding effect of trainee involvement during laparoscopic colectomy for cancer is of utmost importance. Here, we hypothesized that resident involvement was associated with worsened 30-day mortality and 30-day overall morbidity in this patient population. METHODS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy for oncologic diagnosis from 2005 to 2012 were assessed using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset. Propensity score matching accounted for demographics, comorbidities, case complexity, and operative time. Attending only cases were compared to junior, middle, chief resident, and fellow level cohorts to assess primary outcomes of 30-day mortality and 30-day overall morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 13,211 patients met inclusion criteria, with 4075 (30.8%) cases lacking trainee involvement and 9136 (69.2%) involving a trainee. Following propensity matching, junior (PGY 1-2) and middle level (PGY 3-4) resident involvement was not associated with worsened outcomes. Chief (PGY 5) resident involvement was associated with worsened 30-day overall morbidity (15.5 vs. 18.6%, p = 0.01). Fellow (PGY > 5) involvement was associated with worsened 30-day overall morbidity (16.0 vs. 21.0%, p < 0.001), serious morbidity (9.3 vs. 13.5%, p < 0.001), minor morbidity (9.8 vs. 13.1%, p = 0.002), and surgical site infection (7.9 vs. 10.5%, p = 0.006). No differences were seen in 30-day mortality for any resident level. CONCLUSION: Following propensity-matched analysis of cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy, chief residents, and fellows were associated with worsened operative outcomes compared to attending along cases, while junior and mid-level resident outcomes were no different. Further study is necessary to determine what effect the PGY surgical trainee level has on post-operative morbidity in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy in the context of multiple collinear factors.","1432-2218     Kasten, Kevin R     Celio, Adam C     Trakimas, Lauren     Manwaring, Mark L     Spaniolas, Konstantinos     Journal Article     Germany     Surg Endosc. 2018 Feb;32(2):702-711. doi: 10.1007/s00464-017-5726-3.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of radiographic studies for cervical spine trauma. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: An orthopaedic spine surgeon (SS), an orthopaedic traumatologist (OT), an orthopaedic spine fellow (SF), and an orthopaedic chief resident (CR) were independently presented thirty-nine cases of cervical spine trauma imaged with adequate plain radiographs and with CT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement was measured by calculation of kappa coefficients. RESULTS: The detection rate of total fractures on plain radiographs alone ranged from 47 percent to 71 percent, and the diagnosis changed an average 53 percent of cases. Change in treatment plans ranged from 10 percent (SS) to 46 percent (CR) of cases. Of these changes, undertreatment occurred as follows: SS =3 percent, OT =8 percent, SF =36 percent, and CR = 46 percent. The mean kappa coefficient for intraobserver agreement of treatment plans was 0.69. The experienced observers demonstrated ""excellent"" agreement with an average kappa coefficient of 0.85, whereas the mean coefficient for inexperienced observers was 0.54 or ""moderate"" agreement. Complete diagnostic agreement occurred between the experienced observers after review of both the plain films and CT scans. The interobserver agreement of treatment plans for the experienced observers increased from 0.79 to 0.88. CONCLUSIONS: CT scanning afforded additional information for all observers. Experienced observers can reliably determine treatment plans for cervical spine trauma diagnosed on plain films alone, whereas inexperienced observers are less reliable.

20142127,Effect of the night float system on operative case volume for senior surgical residents,2009,1,1,J Surg Educ,1878-7452,66,6,314-8,"Kelly, R. J., Jr. and Senkowski, C. K.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: In response to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandated 80-hour workweek, the night float coverage model was one system created to comply with the work-hour restriction. However, concern has risen as to the operative case volume achieved with this model. The purpose of this study is to determine which system of call (night float vs traditional rotating call) provided the senior surgical resident with the greatest surgical case volume while in compliance with the 80-hour workweek. METHODS: A nonrandomized sequential study to evaluate the ACGME surgical operative logs (SOLs) for surgical chief residents at Memorial University Medical Center (MUMC), which is a level 1 trauma center, from 2006 to 2008 was conducted. The night float system (NFS) consisted of a PGY-4 or -5 assigned to in-house general surgery and trauma call from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am Monday through Friday morning and a 24-hour shift from 6:00 am on Sunday to 6:00 am Monday morning. Two months of night call rotations (nights) are performed each year per resident with the other 10 months devoted to daytime rotations (days). Conversely, the traditional rotating call schedule (TCS) placed each resident on-call every sixth night for a 30-hour period. The TCS required the resident to average approximately 3 weekday and 2 weekend calls per month. The data examined include all cases on the ACGME SOL submitted by each PGY-4 and 5 residents over a 2-year span. Specific designation of cases between night and day rotations was evaluated while on the NFS, and the total cases volume performed on the NFS and the TCS were analyzed. RESULTS: An evaluation of the 2006-2007 (NFS) year demonstrates an average of 16 cases per month while on nights as compared with 20 cases per month while on day rotations. The caseload on the night rotation was less than day rotations at the PGY-4/5 level. An analysis of the 2006-2007 (NFS) and 2007-2008 (TCS) for PGY-4/5 residents revealed an average total caseload of 224 and 276, respectively. A statistically significant total case difference of 52 cases over the entire year between the 2 systems of call was appreciated. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the work-hour restrictions, maximizing surgical education has become a necessity. With the various call systems used throughout general surgery programs, this study specifically compares a traditional 1-in-6 call schedule versus an NFS. Senior residents lost significant operative experience while operating under an NFS as compared with a TCS. Evidence suggests that the more hours spent by a chief resident during normal operative time elicits more operative experience.","1878-7452     Kelly, Robert J Jr     Senkowski, Christopher K     Evaluation Studies     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2009 Nov-Dec;66(6):314-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2009.07.009.

Methodology: U.S. pediatric residency directors and chief residents were surveyed using a questionnaire designed by the authors. Percentage tabulation of the questions was performed. Chi-square analysis of two questions was done to determine if there was an association between the responses given and whether or not a respondent was from a program that offered training to their residents. Results: Over half of the respondents indicated that their programs offered training in the care of GLB youth. This increased to over three fourths when those respondents who indicated that their program was planning such training efforts were included. There was a broad distribution in the form and prevalence of training techniques. Over 90% of the respondents indicated that they valued the inclusion of GLB youth issues into residency curricula. A lesser majority indicated an awareness of community referrals for GLB youth. Conclusions: A large majority of pediatric residencies are either training their residents about the needs of GLB youth or are developing such training opportunities.

21683391,Do chief resident scores on the in-service examination predict their performance on the American Board of Urology Qualifying Examination?,2011,1,1,J Urol,0022-5347 (Print) 0022-5347,186,2,634-7,"Kerfoot, B. P. and Baker, H. and Connelly, D. and Joseph, D. B. and Matson, S. and Ritchey, M. L.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: The American Urological Association In-Service Examination and the American Board of Urology Qualifying Examination are written multiple choice tests that cover all domains in urology. We investigated whether In-Service Examination performance could identify chief residents who scored in the lowest quartile on the Qualifying Examination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All urology chief residents in the United States and Canada in 2008 and 2009 were eligible to participate in this study. In-Service Examination 2008 and Qualifying Examination 2009 performance data were obtained from the American Urological Association and American Board of Urology, respectively. Data were analyzed with the Pearson correlation and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 257 American and Canadian chief residents who completed the Qualifying Examination 2009, 194 (75%) enrolled in this study and were included in analysis. Overall In-Service Examination 2008 scores correlated significantly with Qualifying Examination 2009 scores (r=0.55, p<0.001), accounting for 30% of score variance. Substantial variability in In-Service Examination-Qualifying Examination rankings was notable among individual residents. An In-Service Examination 2008 cutoff percentile rank of 40% identified chief residents in the lowest quartile on the Qualifying Examination 2009 with 71% sensitivity, 77% specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 3.1 and 0.4 (positive and negative likelihood ratios, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The substantial variability of In-Service Examination-Qualifying Examination performance among individual chief residents limits In-Service Examination predictive utility. A single In-Service Examination score should not be used to make a high stakes judgment about an individual resident. In-Service Examination scores should be used as 1 part of an overall evaluation program to prospectively identify residents who could benefit from additional educational support.","1527-3792     Kerfoot, B Price     Baker, Harley     Connelly, Donna     Joseph, David B     Matson, Sonia     Ritchey, Michael L     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

DESIGN: An anonymous, web-based survey of chief residents in otolaryngology. METHODS: Respondents described their experience in pediatric otolaryngology using a 5-point Likert scale and reported their comfort levels (yes/no) with various medical and surgical issues in pediatric otolaryngology. RESULTS: The survey was successfully completed by 70 respondents, representing a response rate of 26%. The majority of the respondents reported positive experiences with regard to the following aspects of pediatric otolaryngology training: didactics (81%), clinical research opportunities (78%), positive faculty role models (87%), career mentorship (74%), independent medical (84%) and surgical (81%) decision-making, and overall comprehensive residency experience (87%). Basic science research opportunities (50%) were reported as less available than clinical research opportunities (78%) (P = .002). Compared with other surveyed issues, a lower comfort level was reported for management of craniofacial anomalies (P < .001), excision of large lymphatic malformations (P < .001), cochlear implantation (P < .001), laryngotracheal reconstruction (P < .001), and surgical correction of velopharyngeal insufficiency (P < .001). No statistically significant difference was noted in responses based on the presence of a fellowship program at the institution. CONCLUSIONS: The residency experience in pediatric otolaryngology is perceived as comprehensive by graduating chief residents participating in this survey. The presence of a fellowship program does not appear to negatively impact the residency experience. Based on the reported comfort levels, the management of complex issues in pediatric otolaryngology may require additional training.","Kerscher, Kara     Tabaee, Abtin     Ward, Robert     Haddad, Joseph Jr     Grunstein, Eli     Journal Article     United States     Laryngoscope. 2008 Apr;118(4):718-22. doi: 10.1097/MLG.0b013e3181620847.

OBJECTIVE: To examine incorporation of EBM into journal club (JC) and other venues within pediatric residency programs. DESIGN/METHODS: A 30-question confidential survey was designed to determine how residents are taught and practice EBM. The survey was sent to the chief resident (CR) at all North American pediatric residency programs (N = 192). Nonrespondents were sent surveys 4 and 8 weeks later. RESULTS: The response rate was 80% (n = 153). Pediatric residency programs varied in size from 12 to 132 residents from responses in 39 states. Most programs (97%, confidence interval [CI], 92-99) used EBM. JC (89%, CI, 83-93), noontime lectures (62%, CI, 54-70), and morning report (61%, CI, 53-69) were the most common venues used to teach EBM. JC (58%, CI, 50-66), morning report (11%, CI, 6-17), and resident workshop (11%, CI, 6-17) were the most effective venues to teach EBM, although resident workshops were as effective as JC to teach EBM in programs offering workshops (38% each, CI, 21-56). Most CRs felt confident in their ability to practice EBM (56%, CI, 48-64), but few CRs felt that their program could teach EBM (7%) or evaluate EBM effectiveness (20%). CONCLUSIONS: EBM is common throughout pediatric residencies. JC was the most effective venue in which to teach EBM, unless a workshop was offered. Most CRs thought it was important to teach EBM, but did not feel confident in their program's ability to teach EBM.","Kersten, Hans B     Randis, Tara M     Giardino, Angelo P     Journal Article     United States     Ambul Pediatr. 2005 Sep-Oct;5(5):302-5. doi: 10.1367/A04-182R1.1.

DESIGN: We created a CCC that meets monthly and at each meeting reviews a resident class for milestone performance, a competency (by a faculty competency champion), a resident rotation service, and any other resident or issue of concern. SETTING: University surgical residency program. PARTICIPANTS: The CCC members include the program director, associate program directors, director of surgical curriculum, competency champions, departmental chair, 2 at-large faculty members, and the administrative chief residents. RESULTS: Seven residents were placed on remediation (later renamed as coaching) during the academic year after falling behind on milestone progression in one or more competencies. An additional 4 residents voluntarily placed themselves on remediation for medical knowledge after receiving in-training examination scores that the residents (not the CCC membership) considered substandard. All but 2 of the remediated/coached residents successfully completed all area milestone performance but some chose to stay on the medical knowledge competency strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly meetings of the CCC make milestone evaluation less burdensome. In addition, the expectations of the residents are clearer and more tangible. ""Competency champions"" who are familiar with the milestones allow effective coaching strategies and documentation of clear performance improvements in competencies for successful completion of residency training.

The survey data allow comparative analyses to be performed among training programs regarding resident education, benefits, clinical demands, and other resident-related issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to all accredited programs registered in the A3CR2 database (150 total programs). The yearly questions address demographic information concerning the individual programs including academic affiliation, number of radiologic examinations performed per resident, changes in the number of residents per program, and financial compensation. The rotating questions, which are revisited every 4 years, focused on preparation for the American Board of Radiology examinations, educational issues, and employment outlook. RESULTS: Completed surveys were received from 55 programs (37.3%). Among the responses, three issues prevailed: (a) increased number of examinations performed per resident, with resultant decrease in educational time, (b) decreased quality of education in all sections of radiology and decreased number of educational conferences, and (c) improved employment outlook, but continued trend of fewer residents choosing a career in academics. CONCLUSION: The current boom in the radiology job market and the increased number of radiologic examinations performed annually appear to adversely affect radiologic education through a decreased number of conferences and an increased number of radiologic examinations performed per resident.","Khan, Faraz A     Bhalla, Sanjeev     Jost, R Gilbert     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 2002 Jan;9(1):89-97.

Periodic assessment of pubertal maturation by physicians is crucial for timely identification of puberty-related disorders. With this pilot study, we aimed to assess the attitudes, knowledge and practices of pubertal assessment by current US pediatric trainees. Methods An anonymous online survey questionnaire was sent to categorical pediatric residents at different levels of training and pediatric chief residents across the US. Results We received responses from 2496 pediatric residents from all over the US. We found that 96% of trainees understand the importance of assessing SMR, 62% feel confident in assessing it and 55% feel comfortable assessing the need for an endocrinology referral. Only 33% of trainees performed external genital exams during all regular clinic visits while 26.9% never performed them during sick visits and 6% never assessed SMR during any of the patient visits. Higher levels of training and having completed an endocrinology rotation were associated with improvement in comfort level, practice and knowledge of trainees regarding pubertal assessment. Conclusion This study revealed that the current clinical practices of performing external genital exams and SMR among pediatric residents need improvement. Stronger reinforcement from continuity clinic preceptors and/or online and clinic based resources for SMR assessment for trainees may improve adherence to the recommended guidelines.","2191-0278     Khokhar, Aditi     Ravichandran, Yagnaram     Stefanov, Dimitre G     Perez-Colon, Sheila     Journal Article     Germany     Int J Adolesc Med Health. 2017 Jul 6. pii: /j/ijamh.ahead-of-print/ijamh-2016-0122/ijamh-2016-0122.xml. doi: 10.1515/ijamh-2016-0122.

METHODS: Chief residents of various psychiatry residency programs were surveyed. RESULTS: One hundred two chief residents were surveyed. Seventy two (70.58%) completed the survey. Eighty four percent of the respondents reported that they were aware of the competencies. The number of patients required for competency determination in five areas of psychotherapy varied widely among the programs. Global assessment by psychotherapy supervisors was the most commonly used method of competency determination (61%). Nineteen (26%) chief residents opined that not all the faculty members involved in teaching and assessing competencies are qualified to do so. Only 23 (31%) of respondents reported that competency criteria were well integrated into the residency curriculum. CONCLUSION: The little consistency in psychotherapy competency determination across various programs, the differential preparedness of programs for competencies and the lack of consistent integration of competencies into residency curricula call for development and implementation of more uniform assessment methods. This variability also calls into question the decision to establish a standard in five areas of psychotherapy competency.","Khurshid, Khurshid A     Bennett, Jeffrey I     Vicari, Sandy     Lee, Karen L     Broquet, Karen E     Journal Article     United States     Acad Psychiatry. 2005 Nov-Dec;29(5):452-8. doi: 10.1176/appi.ap.29.5.452.

Although it is well reported that physicians tend to have a high incidence of minor psychiatric disorders, the magnitude of the problem remains unclear. Interns and residents are thought to be under substantial amount of stress, and tend to have psychiatric disorder. In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the occupational stress and depression of residents. METHODS: The participants of this study were surgical and medical residents in a tertiary hospital in Korea. For measurement of occupational stress, we used an occupational stress scale. In addition, to evaluate the prevalence of depression, we used the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: Female doctors showed higher degree of occupational stress than the males. The interns and chief residents showed higher degree of occupational stress than the other residents. Interestingly, in this study, most of the participants experienced a depressive mood. Compared with the general population, job demand and culture of workplace were high. Occupational stress was the only significant predictor of a depressive mood. CONCLUSION: Hospital residents experience a high degree of occupational stress leading to a depressed mood due to various risk factors. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the occupational stress of residents early, to encourage positive competition and peer and social support, and to help improve the residents' ability to cope with stress.","Kim, Keon     Lee, Sunhwa     Choi, Yoon Hee     Journal Article     Korea (South)     Clin Exp Emerg Med. 2015 Jun 30;2(2):117-122. doi: 10.15441/ceem.15.002. eCollection 2015 Jun.

C. and Fisher, J. G. and Delman, K. A. and Hinman, J. M. and Srinivasan, J. K.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical simulation is an important adjunct in surgical education. The majority of operative procedures can be simplified to core components. This study aimed to quantify a cadaver-based simulation course utility in improving exposure to fundamental maneuvers, resident and attending confidence in trainee capability, and if this led to earlier operative independence. DESIGN: A list of fundamental surgical procedures was established by a faculty panel. Residents were assigned to a group led by a chief resident. Residents performed skills on cadavers appropriate for PGY level. A video-recorded examination where they narrated and demonstrated a task independently was then graded by attendings using standardized rubrics. Participants completed surveys regarding improvements in knowledge and confidence. SETTING: The course was conducted at the Emory University School of Medicine and the T3 Laboratories in Atlanta, GA. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 133 residents and 41 attendings participated in the course. 133 (100%) participating residents and 32 (78%) attendings completed surveys. RESULTS: Resident confidence in completing the assigned skill independently increased from 3 (2-3) to 4 (3-4), p < 0.01. Residents stated that a median of 40% (interquartile range: 20%-60%) of procedures were performed for the first time in the course, and the same number had been performed only in the course. The percentage of skills attendings believed residents could perform independently increased from 40% (40%-60%) to 60% (60%->80%), p < 0.04. Attendings were more likely to grant autonomy in the operating room after this exercise (4 [3-5]). CONCLUSIONS: A cadaveric skills course focused on fundamental maneuvers with objective confirmation of success is a viable adjunct to clinical operative experience. Residents were formally exposed to fundamental surgical maneuvers earlier as a result of this course. This activity improved both resident and attending confidence in trainee operative skill, resulting in increased attending willingness to grant a higher level of autonomy in the operating room.","1878-7452     Kim, Steven C     Fisher, Jeremy G     Delman, Keith A     Hinman, Johanna M     Srinivasan, Jahnavi K     Journal Article     Review     United States     J Surg Educ. 2016 Nov - Dec;73(6):e33-e41. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.06.014.

More recently, also considered important is training on the broader issues of health care delivery and public policy, especially since the environment of medicine is changing rapidly. With limited curricular time these issues must compete with the traditional and important clinical training. To evaluate how these subjects have been included in internal medicine training, the Resident Physicians Section (RPS) of the American Society of Internal Medicine (ASIM) sponsored a survey of United States internal medicine chief residents which was conducted by the Internal Medicine Center to Advance Research and Education (IMCARE). The objectives of the study were to 1) study the extent of training on health care delivery and public policy issues offered to residents by internal medicine residency programs; 2) assess training opportunities now available; and 3) determine areas of study not fulfilling perceived needs. The questionnaire contained 12 questions. Chief residents rated the 1) quality of their program in preparing residents on health care delivery, public policy issues and practice management; 2) level of instruction provided on 12 topics; and 3) degree of priority these same topics should have. Respondents were asked to identify 1) any other relevant areas their residency program covered particularly well; 2) the amount of time which should be devoted to these socioeconomic topics in each year of training; and 3) the most appealing formats for learning about these topics. Despite the rapidly growing influence of socioeconomic issues on medical practice, many chief residents perceive that important topics are not being addressed adequately. This study provides information on areas addressed well and topics that should receive greater attention. Recommendations are made for further studies and strategies to increase the emphasis on socioeconomic topics during medical education.","King, B F     Kindig, R C     Noah, W H     Tuteur, P G     Journal Article     United States     Internist. 1990 Jul-Aug;31(7):suppl 3-15.

E.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The demands for cosmetic procedures are increasing. Dermatologists perform many of these procedures, therefore adequate education and training during residency is important. Surveys demonstrate dermatology residents desire more training even while faculty members believe this has already become a more prominent feature of resident education. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the time and methods dedicated to education and training of cosmetic procedures in dermatology residency. METHODS: A 26-question survey was developed and electronically distributed in May 2010 to dermatology program directors via the Association of Professors of Dermatology list-serve with their approval. Program directors were asked to forward the e-mail to their instructors of cosmetic/procedural dermatology, and chief residents. Responses were anonymous. RESULTS: A total of 86 responses were collected. In all, 67% (n = 54) of respondents had formal lectures focusing on cosmetic dermatology. Lecture topics reported by more than 50% of respondents included botulinum toxin injection, lasers, soft tissue augmentation, chemical peels, and sclerotherapy. Topics such as dermabrasion, liposuction, and scar revision were less commonly taught. The most commonly encountered and performed procedures were botulinum toxin injection and lasers (100%, n = 86); 98.8% (n = 85) encounter soft tissue augmentation and 95.4% (n = 82) encounter both chemical peels and sclerotherapy. Resident experience performing procedures as the first assistant or as the first surgeon varied widely. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this study are that the data were subjectively reported so results may differ from the true amount of time spent in any activity. The data may be biased by the population that responded as they may have strong opinions supporting or opposing training in cosmetic procedures. The data also may have been skewed by the small percentage of participants who were instructors of cosmetic dermatology (21%), chief residents (20%), and others respondents (8% total). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the variability of training in cosmetic procedures. The challenge for programs is to find the balance between insufficiency and overemphasis. The results of this study will hopefully assist programs in determining the quantity and methods of resident training in cosmetic procedures.","1097-6787     Kirby, Joslyn S     Adgerson, Cheri N     Anderson, Bryan E     Journal Article     United States     J Am Acad Dermatol. 2013 Feb;68(2):e23-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2011.05.010.

J. and Baker, L. and Sharp, J. and Guarino, C.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that predict fourth- and fifth-year surgical resident satisfaction of attending teaching quality. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With the training of surgical residents undergoing major changes, a key issue facing surgical educators is whether high-quality surgeons can still be produced. Innovative techniques (eg, computer simulation surgery) are being developed to substitute partially for conventional teaching methods. However, an aspect of training that cannot be so easily replaced is the faculty-resident interaction. This study investigates resident perceptions of attending teaching quality and the factors associated with this faculty-resident interaction to identify predictors of resident educational satisfaction. METHODS: A national survey of clinical fourth- and fifth-year surgery residents in 125 academically affiliated general surgery training programs was performed. The survey contained 67 questions and addressed demographics, hospital, and service characteristics, as well as surgery, education, and clinical care-related factors. Univariate analyses were performed to describe the characteristics of the sample; multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the factors associated with resident educational satisfaction. RESULTS: The response rate was 61.5% (n = 756). Average age was 32 years; most were male (79%), white (72%), and married (69%); 42% had children. Ninety-five percent of respondents graduated from U.S. medical schools, and the average debt was $80,307. Of 20 potentially mutable factors, 6 variables had positive associations with resident education satisfaction and 7 had negative associations. Positive factors included the resident being the operating surgeon in major surgeries, substantial citing of evidence-based literature by the attending, attending physicians giving spontaneous or unplanned presentations, increasing the continuity of care, clinical teaching aimed at the chief resident level, and having clinical decisions made together by both the attending and resident. There were 7 negative factors such as overly supervising in surgery, being interrupted so much that teaching was ineffective, and attending physicians being rushed and/or eager to finish rounds. CONCLUSION: This study identifies several factors that were associated with resident educational satisfaction. It offers the perspective of the learners (ie, residents) and, importantly, highlights mutable factors that surgery faculty (and departments) may consider changing to improve surgery resident education and satisfaction. Improving such satisfaction may help to produce a better product.","Ko, Clifford Y     Escarce, Jose J     Baker, Laurence     Sharp, Jennifer     Guarino, Cassandra     Journal Article     United States     Ann Surg. 2005 Feb;241(2):373-80.

However, the chief resident position has historically only been held by a few residents. As fourth-year chief residents are becoming less common, we considered a new model for rotating third-year residents as the chief resident. METHODS: Online surveys were given to all 29 internal medicine residents in a single university-based program after implementation of a leadership curriculum and specific job description for the third-year chief resident. Chief residents evaluated themselves on various aspects of leadership. Participation was voluntary. Descriptive statistics were generated using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: Thirteen junior (first- or second-year) resident responses reported that the chief residents elicited input from others (mean rating 6.8), were committed to the team (6.8), resolved conflict (6.7), ensured efficiency, organization and productivity of the team (6.7), participated actively (7.0), and managed resources (6.6). Responses from senior residents averaged 1 point higher for each item; this pattern repeated itself in teaching evaluations. Chief resident self-evaluators were more comfortable running a morning report (8.4) than with being chief resident (5.8). CONCLUSION: The feasibility of preparing internal medicine residents for leadership roles through a rotating PGY-3 (postgraduate year) chief residency curriculum was explored at a small internal medicine residency, and we suggest extending the study to include other programs.","Kolade, Victor O     Staton, Lisa J     Jayarajan, Ramesh     Bentley, Nanette K     Huang, Xiangke     Journal Article     United States     J Community Hosp Intern Med Perspect. 2014 Jul 31;4. pii: 24511. doi: 10.3402/jchimp.v4.24511. eCollection 2014.

R. and Howard, D. O. and Gyftopoulos, S. and Davidovitch, R. I. and Egol, K. A.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the lowest estimated radiation dose necessary to reproducibly detect intra-articular air in the knee joint of a cadaver model. METHODS: Ten adult fresh-frozen cadaver knees with intact joint capsules were thawed and scanned at 5 decreasing radiation doses (decreasing by approximately half from 8.42 to 0.74 mGy) after introducing increasing volumes (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 cc) of intra-articular air. Scans were performed using 2.0-mm slice thickness from the distal one-third of the femur to the proximal one-third of the tibia. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions of each scan using 1.0-mm slice thickness were rendered. All scans were reviewed by (1) a single attending radiologist, (2) a single attending orthopedic surgeon, and (3) a single chief resident, for the presence of intra-articular air. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography scan to detect intra-articular air at each volume of intra-articular air (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 cc) was 100% at 0.74 mGy--the radiation threshold dose (scan parameters: voltage 80 kV, current: 33 mA, and scan time: 12.17 seconds). The effective radiation dose at 0.74 mGy for a CT scan of the knee is approximately 0.10 mSV. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography scan to detect traumatic knee arthrotomies can be successfully accomplished at a threshold radiation dose of 0.74 mGy and for an intra-articular volume of 0.1 cc of air. This low radiation dose protocol and volume of intra-articular air should be taken into consideration with future studies evaluating the use of CT scan to detect traumatic arthrotomies.","1531-2291     Konda, Sanjit R     Howard, Daniel O     Gyftopoulos, Soterios     Davidovitch, Roy I     Egol, Kenneth A     Evaluation Studies     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Orthop Trauma. 2013 Sep;27(9):505-8. doi: 10.1097/BOT.0b013e3182821505.

K. and Fletcher, J. and Lechuga, C. and McKee, M. D.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Integrating family into family medicine has been recognized as important for the discipline, yet there is little known about how family-oriented care is taught in training environments. This paper presents results of a national survey assessing the status of teaching family concepts/skills in family medicine residency programs. METHODS: We sought to survey the program director (PD), a behavioral science faculty (BSF), and a chief resident (CR) from all 454 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) family medicine residency programs. RESULTS: Respondents (n=489) were PDs (29%), CRs (34%), and BSF (36%). Of all respondents, 47% to 66% believe that integrating family concepts/skills into family medicine training is very important (highest level of importance). However, only 19%--23% believe their own programs place this level of importance on this curricular area. Less weight is given to family topics when compared with other behavior science subjects. Behavioral scientists who reported inclusion of (1) family concepts/skills in the formulation of ACGME competencies, (2) evaluation of residents on these skills, or (3) the presence of a family champion or scholar in the program, all reported teaching significantly more family-oriented skills compared to those that did not, respectively, 1 (6.96 versus 4.48), 2 (6.55 versus 4.97), and 3 (6.62 versus 4.54). CONCLUSIONS: Teaching about the family in family medicine continues to be highly valued among educators and their trainees; however, it is not perceived to be similarly valued in residency programs. Current changes in health care offer opportunities to promote and affirm family-oriented care. New curricular strategies are needed so that family-oriented care continues to define the uniqueness of family medicine.","1938-3800     Korin, Eliana C     Odom, Amy J     Newman, Nancy K     Fletcher, Jason     Lechuga, Claudia     McKee, M Diane     Journal Article     United States     Fam Med. 2014 Mar;46(3):209-14.

DESIGN: Fifty subjects with minimal prior simulator exposure were enrolled using an institutional review board-approved protocol. As a measure of baseline performance, medical students (n = 11) and surgery residents (n = 39) completed 3 trials on each of 5 validated video-trainer tasks. Four board-certified surgeons established as laparoscopic experts (with more than 250 basic and more than 50 advanced cases) performed 11 trials on each of the 5 tasks. The mean score was determined and outliers (>2 SDs) were trimmed; the trimmed mean was used as the competency level. Baseline performance of each subject was compared with the competency level for each task. SETTING: All research was performed in a laparoscopic skills training and simulation laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Medical students, surgical residents, and board-certified surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expert scores based on completion time and the number of subjects achieving these scores at baseline testing. RESULTS: For all tasks combined, the competency level was reached by 6% of subjects by the third trial; 73% of these subjects were chief residents, and none were medical students. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the competency level is suitably challenging for novices but is achievable for subjects with more experience.

Team members understand the hierarchy; however, level of expertise may not be inherently obvious to the patient. This study is intended to gain a better understanding of patient knowledge regarding commonly used physician and student titles. Methods: A survey was developed asking patients to match 6 mutually exclusive medical titles to 6 levels of training (amount of education). Categories included attending physician, chief resident, resident, intern, medical student, and pre-medical student. Patients were asked to identify the level of training associated with each title, ranging from no college degree to a medical degree with completion of advanced training. Respondent age, gender, formal medical training, employment in a healthcare field, educational level and personal income were requested. Results: 418 surveys were collected from an academic surgical practice. 43 surveys were excluded for incomplete information. Patients ranged in age from 19-84 years (average age of 50.1 years) and 82% were women. Respondents accurately identified the level of training required for all 6 of the titles in only 44.5% of surveys collected. None correctly identified the level of training for 5 titles, 23% were correct for 4, 8.5% for 3, 11% for 2, and 7.9% were correct for only 1 title. 4.9% were unable to correctly identify the level of training required for any of the titles in the survey. Patients who had at least some college education were more likely to answer correctly than those who had a high school diploma or less (p < 0.001). On the other hand, even among respondents with graduate degrees, 49% were unable to correctly identify the training of all members of the team. Patients who reported annual incomes > $50,000 were more likely to answer correctly than patients with lower incomes (p < 0.00001). However, among patients reporting incomes >$100,000 per year, 43.5% were unable to correctly identify all titles. Female respondents tended to answer more correctly than the men who were surveyed, but this trend did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.053). Interestingly, neither patients who reported having had formal health care training nor patients who had actually been employed in a healthcare field were statistically more likely to answer correctly. Conclusions: Our patients clearly do not understand the distinctions in training among the various members of the surgical team. Institutions and physicians caring for patients with decreased income or educational status may wish to pay particular attention to explaining the academic background and status of team members involved in the medical hierarchy. However, almost half of even our most educated and most affluent patients do not completely understand the levels of training of the team members caring for them.","L71484040     2014-07-21 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

DESIGN: A comparison of 128 CEXs conducted for 32 internal medicine interns by full-time faculty. This paper reports alpha coefficients as measures of internal consistency and several measures of inter-rater reliability. SETTING: A university internal medicine program. Observations were conducted at the end of the internship year. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 32 interns and observers were 12 full-time faculty in the department of medicine. The entire intern group was chosen in order to optimize the spectrum of abilities represented. Patients used for the study were recruited by the chief resident from the inpatient medical service based on their ability and willingness to participate. INTERVENTION: Each intern was observed twice and there were two examiners during each CEX. The examiners were given a standardized preparation and used a format developed over five years of previous pilot studies. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The format appeared to have excellent internal consistency; alpha coefficients ranged from 0.79 to 0.99. However, multiple methods of determining inter-rater reliability yielded similar results; intraclass correlations ranged from 0.23 to 0.50 and generalizability coefficients from a low of 0.00 for the overall rating of the CEX to a high of 0.61 for the physical examination section. Transforming scores to eliminate rater effects and dichotomizing results into pass-fail did not appear to enhance the reliability results. CONCLUSIONS: Although the CEX is a valuable didactic tool, its psychometric properties preclude reliable assessment of clinical skills as a one-time observation.","Kroboth, F J     Hanusa, B H     Parker, S     Coulehan, J L     Kapoor, W N     Brown, F H     Karpf, M     Levey, G S     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Gen Intern Med. 1992 Mar-Apr;7(2):174-9.

S.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, surgical training has used an apprenticeship model but has more recently moved to a service-based model, with groups of residents working with groups of attending surgeons. We developed an apprenticeship rotation to enhance one-on-one interaction between chief residents and selected faculty. We hypothesized that the apprenticeship rotation would be effective for teaching nontechnical skills (NTS) and core competencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An apprenticeship rotation was created at a university-based surgery residency in which each chief resident selected a single attending surgeon with whom to work exclusively with for a 4-week period. Emphasis was placed on teaching intraoperative NTS as well as the 4 difficult-to-teach Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies (DCC): Interpersonal and Communication Skills, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, Professionalism, and Systems-Based Practice. Participants were surveyed afterwards about their rotation using a 5-point Likert scale. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare differences depending on data distribution. RESULTS: All (13/13) the chief residents and 67% (8/12) faculty completed the survey. Overall, 85% of residents and 87.5% of faculty would recommend the rotation to other residents/faculty members. Both residents and faculty reported improvement in trainees' technical skills and NTS. Residents reported improvement in all 4 DCC, particularly, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, Professionalism, and Interpersonal and Communication Skills. CONCLUSION: The apprenticeship rotation is an effective means of teaching residents both NTS and DCC essential for independent practice. Consideration should be given to introducing this program into surgical curricula nationally.","1878-7452     Kwakye, Gifty     Chen, Xiaodong Phoenix     Havens, Joaquim M     Irani, Jennifer L     Yule, Steven     Smink, Douglas S     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2015 Nov-Dec;72(6):1095-101. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.07.003.

J. and Weiss, A. P.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: To determine if a slight modification of the 1987 Eaton-Glickel staging and interpreting 4 standardized radiographs for trapeziometacarpal (TMC) osteoarthritis (OA) improved analysis, to determine if a quantifiable index measurement from a single Robert (pronated anteroposterior) view enhanced reproducibility, and to examine whether improved radiographic staging correlated to clinically relevant disease and thus support validity. METHODS: We analyzed 4 thumb radiographs (posteroanterior, lateral, Robert, and stress views) in 60 consecutive subjects representing an adult population spectrum of asymptomatic to advanced disease. Two experienced hand surgeons (A.L.L. and A.P.C.W.), 1 chief resident (A.J.B.), and 1 medical student (J.M.M.) performed the analysis on each subject's radiographs. We analyzed all 4 radiographs for Eaton and modified Eaton staging and then later analyzed only the Robert view for the thumb osteoarthritis (ThOA) index measurement. The radiographs were randomized and reread a week later for each classification at separate times. Surgically excised trapeziums from 20/60 subjects were inspected for first metacarpal surface disease and correlated to the 3 classifications. RESULTS: All 3 staging classifications demonstrated high reproducibility, with the intraclass correlation coefficient averaging 0.73 for the Eaton, 0.83 for the modified Eaton, and 0.95 for the ThOA index. Articular wear and metacarpal surface eburnation correlated highest to the ThOA index, with advanced disease 1.55 or greater correlating to Eaton III/IV and modified Eaton stage 3/4 in a linear relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The ThOA index based on a Robert view provided a measurable alternative to Eaton staging and correlated to severity of surgically relevant thumb TMC OA. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A simple reproducible radiographic measurement may enhance TMC OA classification and provide a reliable means to predict clinical disease.

"",Resident perceptions of factors contributing to adverse events and near misses,2012,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,27,,S299,"Lamba, A. R. and Fletcher, K. E.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71296909,English,,,"BACKGROUND: In the last 10 years, the concepts of patient safety and medical errors have gained attention. Patient safety is becoming a more prominent part of the medicine culture, and both hospitals and residency programs have started to increase patient safety education. Current ways to detect adverse events include chart auditing and automated data mining of laboratory and pharmacy data. These methods are useful; however, they may only be able to capture adverse events and not catch near misses. In our study, we sought to find out what factors house staff perceive are contributors to near misses and adverse events. METHODS: A survey was developed by the study team after a review of the literature. It was reviewed by the chief residents and program directors for content and clarity. The survey was anonymous and contained demographic questions and 5 additional questions about adverse events/ near misses and perceived contributors to them. Adverse events, near misses and categories of potential contributors were defined in the survey. The study was approved by our institutional review board. Participants were internal medicine interns and residents at a single Midwestern internal medicine residency program. The survey was distributed at a regularly scheduled educational meeting. Participants were asked to state if they could recall either an adverse event or near miss occurring within the last 12 months. Participants were then asked to state which of the following factors the adverse event or near miss was related to 1) Patient factors, 2) Task and technology factors, 3) Staff/Individual factors, 4) Work environmental factors, 5) Organizational and management factors, 6) Institutional context factors. RESULTS: Participation rate was 91%. The survey was completed by 30 interns and 39 residents (PGY2 and above). Twenty-nine (42%) were male. Mean age was 28.6 (SD 2.5). Most (79%) were able to recall an adverse event within the last 12 months. All but one intern (97%) could recall an event, while 65% of residents could recall an event (p<0.01 for the comparison between interns and residents). Participants identified a mean of 1.8 (SD 0.8) contributing factors per event. Staff/individual factors were cited most commonly as contributors to adverse events/near misses, reported by 74% of those who reported an event. This was noted equally commonly by interns and residents. Task and technology factors were reported by 38%, organization/management factors by 32%, patient factors by 19%, environmental factors by 13% and institutional context by 6%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the majority of interns and residents have experienced an adverse event and/or near miss within the last 12 months. A larger percentage of interns as compared to residents recalled an adverse event or near miss. Staff/individual factors were cited by both interns and residents as the most common type of contributing factor. This suggests that our current culture of medicine still focuses on individual blame rather than systems issues as the source of errors.","L71296909     2014-01-24 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The objective of this paper is to report the results of a sample of the 394 accredited family practice residencies to determine the evaluation methods used and their corresponding value to the program. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to program directors and chief residents of all accredited family practice residency programs. RESULTS: Responses were received from the director or chief resident of 354 (90%) programs. For 195 programs, both the chief resident and program director responded. The five most common evaluation methods were the American Board of Family Practice In-Training Examination, formative review sessions, resident chart review, list of procedures performed, and family medicine conference attendance. Of 195 programs for which directors and chief residents both responded, directors and chief residents differed significantly in the reported number of evaluation methods but not in perceived value of those evaluation methods. Neither geographic region, community or university affiliation, class size, nor age of program was associated with differences in numbers of evaluation methods or perceived value of those methods.

DESIGN: Prospective registry of consecutive cases recorded by 7 rural general surgeons working in one department of surgery from December 31, 1994, through March 30, 1996. Comparison with the 1995 Report C (Resident Operative Logs) of the Residency Review Committee. National survey of surgical residency programs regarding formal gynecology experience. SETTING: Nine rural community hospitals in the Midwest. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing surgery in 9 cities with populations of fewer than 10000. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of surgery and postoperative (30-day) mortality. RESULTS: Two thousand four hundred twenty procedures were performed by 7 surgeons practicing in 9 cities with populations of 1500 to 8000. There were 6 (0.25%) postoperative deaths. Case types are as follows: endoscopy, 686 (28.3%); gynecology, 498 (20.6%); hernia, 241 (10%); colorectal, 194 (8%); biliary, 183 (7.6%); cesarean sections, 130 (5.4%); breast, 129 (5.3%); orthopedic, 115 (4.8%); carpal tunnel, 63 (2.6%); otolaryngology, 35 (1.4%); and endocrine, 1 (0.4%); for a total of 2420 (100%).

In many cases, surgical residents are too busy with their responsibilities to interact with the medical students. Furthermore, little incentive is provided for them to do so. Recently, in our institution, we have implemented a standardized bedside curriculum that allows medical students to teach surgical residents on core surgical topics. Methods: On daily bedside teaching rounds, common surgical topics were randomized and presented by either medical students or the chief resident to the surgical team. Pre-rotation and post-rotation surgical knowledge of surgical residents were assessed by the use of questions adapted from a general surgery textbook on topics taught on bedside rounds. The mean scores on the pre-rotation and post-rotation examinations were compared on topics taught by the medical students and by the chief resident. An end of rotation evaluation of this study was assessed by a questionnaire survey of the surgery residents. Results were analyzed using a paired student t-test for continuous data. Survey data were collected using a 5-point Likert scale. Results: The subjects on this study included interns rotating from categorical general surgery, medical specialities and surgical subspecialties. An improved performance was noted looking at the pre-rotation and post-rotation mean scores of the residents (55 vs 66; p=0.04). The mean score differential by further comparison of the topics taught by either the medical students or the chief resident were similar (10.5 vs 22.5; p=0.1). All the interns felt the student and resident teaching were educational and would like to see this structure of teaching on other rotations. Conclusions: This study confirms the effectiveness of a structured bedside teaching curriculum by medical students as means of improving performance of surgical residents on a general surgery service. This can improve performance of surgery residents on the mandatory in-service examination (ABSITE). The role of medical students as resident educators is a novel concept and should be encouraged on the general surgery service.","L70973427     2013-01-25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Most studies have found reliability and reproducibility to be poor for fracture classification schemes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the Sanders and Crosby-Fitzgibbons classification systems, two commonly used methods for classifying intra-articular calcaneal fractures. METHODS: Twenty-five CT scans of intra-articular calcaneal fractures occurring at one trauma center were reviewed. The CT images were presented to eight observers (two orthopaedic surgery chief residents, two foot and ankle fellows, two fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma surgeons, and two fellowship-trained foot and ankle surgeons) on two separate occasions 8 weeks apart. On each viewing, observers were asked to classify the fractures according to both the Sanders and Crosby-Fitzgibbons systems. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility were assessed with computer-generated kappa statistics (SAS software; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). RESULTS: Total unanimity (eight of eight observers assigned the same fracture classification) was achieved only 24% (six of 25) of the time with the Sanders system and 36% (nine of 25) of the time with the Crosby-Fitzgibbons scheme. Interobserver reliability for the Sanders classification method reached a moderate (kappa = 0.48, 0.50) level of agreement, when the subclasses were included. The agreement level increased but remained in the moderate (kappa = 0.55, 0.55) range when the subclasses were excluded. Interobserver agreement reached a substantial (kappa = 0.63, 0.63) level with the Crosby-Fitzgibbons system. Intraobserver reproducibility was better for both schemes. The Sanders system with subclasses included reached moderate (kappa = 0.57) agreement, while ignoring the subclasses brought agreement into the substantial (kappa = 0.77) range. The overall intraobserver agreement was substantial (kappa = 0.74) for the Crosby-Fitzgibbons system. CONCLUSIONS: Although intraobserver kappa values reached substantial levels and the Crosby-Fitzgibbons system generally showed greater agreement, we were unable to demonstrate excellent interobserver or intraobserver reliability with either classification scheme. While a system with perfect agreement would be impossible, our results indicate that these classifications lack the reproducibility to be considered ideal.","Lauder, Anthony J     Inda, David J     Bott, Aaron M     Clare, Michael P     Fitzgibbons, Timothy C     Mormino, Matthew A     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Foot Ankle Int. 2006 Apr;27(4):251-5. doi: 10.1177/107110070602700405.

This study sought to determine if torso (chest and abdomen) CT could be avoided in patients with ground level falls. This was a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the trauma service between January 2013 and April 2014. The mechanism of injury was ground level fall or fall from sitting. Patient demographics, physical examination (PE) findings, imaging results, length of stay, and complications were reviewed. History and physical data were based on chief resident or attending documentation. A significant thoracic injury was defined as a hemothorax, a pneumothorax, greater than three rib fractures, or aortic injury. A significant abdominal injury was defined as a solid organ injury, an intra-abdominal hematoma, a hollow viscus injury, aortic injury, or a urologic injury. The trauma service evaluated 156 patients. Nine patients were excluded for intubation or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 13. Of the 147 remaining, mean age was 69 years, mean GCS was 14.8. A chest CT was obtained in 111 (76%). Eight (7%) had a significant thoracic injury. All patients with significant thoracic injury had positive examination findings. No patient with a normal PE was found to have a significant thoracic injury (negative predictive value of 100%). An abdominal CT was obtained in 86 (59%). Five (6%) were found to have a significant abdominal injury. All patients who had a significant radiographic injury had an abnormal PE (negative predictive value of 100%).

The objective is to highlight national similarities, differences, and trends to help programs establish standards and improve residency training. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to 180 accredited diagnostic radiology residency training programs in the United States. The survey covered the usual general topics and more specific topics considered every 4 years; for 2000 the latter were on-call issues and the chief residency year. RESULTS: Completed surveys were returned from 63 programs (35%). Important findings included increased caseload and call commitments, especially for smaller programs. Resident salaries appear to have increased more than the consumer price index. Nonemergent after-hour coverage and teleradiology are now a large part of the resident work practice. Women continue to be underrepresented, with a trend downward. Chief residents are more involved in organizing preparation for board examinations and have greater office facilities and more administrative duties. CONCLUSION: This survey provided useful insights. All levels of residency face increased workloads. On-call hours have not changed, but the work has intensified and the use of teleradiology has increased. Many programs have adopted a ""night-float"" system, and nonemergent after-hours coverage should be considered in any program evaluation. Continued vigilance and sustained efforts are required to ensure that radiology is considered as a specialty by both men and women. With increased demands on attending physicians' time, chief residents may need to take on more administrative responsibilities.","Lawler, L P     Fromke, J     Jost, R G     Evens, R G     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 2001 Aug;8(8):777-81. doi: 10.1016/S1076-6332(03)80586-X.

R. and Whiton, M. A. and Symon, Z. and Wuthrick, E. J. and Doyle, L. and Harrison, A. S. and Dicker, A. P.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: In light of concerns regarding the quality of radiation treatment delivery, we surveyed the practice of quality assurance peer review chart rounds at American academic institutions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An anonymous web-based survey was sent to the chief resident of each institution across the United States. RESULTS: The response rate was 80% (57/71). The median amount of time spent per patient was 2.7 minutes (range, 0.6-14.4). The mean attendance by senior physicians and residents was 73% and 93%, respectively. A physicist was consistently present at peer review rounds in 66% of departments. There was a close association between attendance by senior physicians and departmental organization: in departments with protected time policies, good attendance was 81% vs. 31% without protected time (p = 0.001), and in departments that documented attendance, attending presence was 69% vs. 29% in departments without documentation (p < 0.05). More than 80% of institutions peer review all external beam therapy courses; however, rates were much lower for other modalities (radiosurgery 58%, brachytherapy 40%-47%). Patient history, chart documentation, and dose prescription were always peer reviewed in >75% of institutions, whereas dosimetric details (beams, wedges), isodose coverage, intensity-modulated radiation therapy constraints, and dose-volume histograms were always peer reviewed in 63%, 59%, 42%, and 50% of cases, respectively. Chart rounds led to both minor (defined as a small multileaf collimator change/repeated port film) and major (change to dose prescription or replan with dosimetry) treatment changes. Whereas at the majority of institutions changes were rare (<10% of cases), 39% and 11% of institutions reported that minor and major changes, respectively, were made to more than 10% of cases. CONCLUSION: The implementation of peer review chart rounds seems inconsistent across American academic institutions. Brachytherapy and radiosurgical procedures are rarely reviewed. Attendance by senior physicians is variable, but it improves when scheduling clashes are avoided. The potential effect of a more thorough quality assurance peer review on patient outcomes is not known.","1879-355x     Lawrence, Yaacov Richard     Whiton, Michal A     Symon, Zvi     Wuthrick, Evan J     Doyle, Laura     Harrison, Amy S     Dicker, Adam P     Journal Article     United States     Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Nov 1;84(3):590-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.01.029.

J. and Mucksavage, P. and Lee, D. I.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: To determine whether robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) may be taught to chief residents and fellows without influencing operative outcomes. METHODS: Between August 2011 and June 2012, 388 patients underwent RARP by a single primary surgeon (DIL) at our institution. Our teaching algorithm divides RARP into five stages, and each trainee progresses through the stages in a sequential manner. Statistical analysis was conducted after grouping the cohort according to the surgeons operating the robotic console: attending only (n = 91), attending and fellow (n = 152), and attending and chief resident (n = 145). Approximately normal variables were compared utilizing one-way analysis of variance, and categorical variables were compared utilizing two-tailed chi(2) test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was no difference in mean age (P = 0.590), body mass index (P = 0.339), preoperative SHIM (Sexual Health Inventory for Men) score (P = 0.084), preoperative AUASS (American Urologic Association Symptom Score) (P = 0.086), preoperative prostate-specific antigen (P = 0.258), clinical and pathological stage (P = 0.766 and P = 0.699, respectively), and preoperative and postoperative Gleason score (P = 0.775 and P = 0.870, respectively). Operative outcomes such as mean estimated blood loss (P = 0.807) and length of stay (P = 0.494) were similar. There was a difference in mean operative time (P < 0.001; attending only = 89.3 min, attending and fellow 125.4 min, and attending and chief resident 126.9 min). Functional outcomes at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively such as urinary continence rate (P = 0.977 and P = 0.720, respectively), and SHIM score (P = 0.661 and P = 0.890, respectively) were similar. The rate of positive surgical margins (P = 0.058) was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Training chief residents and fellows to perform RARP may be associated with increased operative times, but does not compromise short-term functional and oncological outcomes.","Lee, Ziho     Lightfoot, Andrew J     Mucksavage, Phillip     Lee, David I     Journal Article     Korea (South)     Prostate Int. 2015 Jun;3(2):47-50. doi: 10.1016/j.prnil.2015.03.005.

"",Avirtual library to promote patient-centered learning on inpatient medical services,2016,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,31,2,S801,"Leiter, R. E. and Zhang, W. and Aronson, K. I.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L72289485,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Medical teams currently lack effective methods of sharing and discussing medical literature that answer clinical questions for daily patient care. We describe the use of a novel, web-based, collaborative reference manager and workspace on the General Medicine ward service. We show how the team's use of this program enhances both the breadth and depth of evidence-based learning at all levels of training (medical student, intern, resident, and attending) in a time-efficient and user friendly manner. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot program is currently being conducted on the PGY4 Chief Resident-led General Medicine service at a large, urban, academic medical center in the Northeastern U.S. This team consists of two medical students, one intern, one senior resident, and an attending physician (one of four Chief Residents) and is charged with caring for a diverse census and promoting the teaching skills of the senior resident as a junior attending. DESCRIPTION: Faculty of 1000 Workspace (F1000) is a suite of tools that assists physicians and scientists with research, writing, collaboration, and reference management. This platform was selected for use on the Medicine service because it allows for the simple addition of citations and full-text papers to a shared bibliography through the use of a web browser plug-in extension. References can be indexed to multiple projects or subprojects visible by different invited users allowing for logical and intuitive organization. The program also encourages collaboration between individuals with shared annotations and online space for discussion. At the beginning of each 2-week block, the attending physician introduces the team members to the online platform and ensures team members have access to the workspace (provided by the institution's medical library). Team members are then able to add articles to a shared project, highlight key portions of the text, annotate them, and comment on each other's annotations. Once a project has been created, it remains active, even after the block has finished, thus providing team members with an indexed repository of patient-centered literature. EVALUATION: To date, three attendings and six residents have participated in the intervention. Faculty and residents have posted annotated articles based on clinical questions raised on the ward rotation. Team members have used the F1000 platform daily, and have reported high ease of use and ready integration into a demanding house staff work flow. Participants posted articles and read those posted by others, but did not discuss them online; most of the discussion has taken place on afternoon teaching rounds. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: As the pilot progresses, we plan to track the number of papers submitted by the team as a whole and by its individual members. As objective measures of the team's utilization of the workspace and engagement with the literature, we will quantify the number of articles annotated by team members at each level and the number of virtual conversations between team members. We will hold focus groups with involved students and residents to ascertain the pilot's impact on their educational experience throughout their block on the Medicine service. We also hope to be able to document the discussions the articles generate so that residents and students have a centralized record of what they have learned on service. As a next step, we plan to expand this pilot to other Medicine services as other hospitalists and attending physicians become more familiar with the program. Eventually, we hope to link projects across the Medicine services to provide residents with an even larger pool of medical literature. We believe that the addition of a web-based, collaborative reference manager and workspace will increase both the quantity of literature reviewed and the quality of evidence-based discussion on a General Medicine teaching service. We expect that this program will inspire the spirit of scholarship and academic rigor in its participa ts, particularly the more junior trainees.","L72289485     2016-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The patient groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, and anesthetic class, but pathologically proven acute cholecystitis was more common in group R (33% vs. 9%; p < 0.005). To analyze operative procedures and outcomes, we compared operative time, frequency of successful operative cholangiography (attempted in all cases), frequency of conversion to open cholecystectomy, major complication rate, and days of postoperative stay for all patients and for those without complications. Of these parameters, only operative time for nonacute cases differed significantly between the groups (144 min for group A vs. 114 min for group R; p < 0.05). Complications in group A included one ductal injury and one case of postoperative pancreatitis; group R had one ductal injury and two cases of postoperative bleeding. We conclude that (a) the learning curve has similar structure for senior surgeons and resident trainees; and (b) the resident learning curve is not hazardous when teaching assistants are trained in the procedure, which has implications for safe instruction and proctoring of residents and staff.","Lekawa, M     Shapiro, S J     Gordon, L A     Rothbart, J     Hiatt, J R     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Surg Laparosc Endosc. 1995 Dec;5(6):455-8.

Advocacy is stressed as a critical component of a physician's function within his or her community and also of performance evaluation during residency training. We sought to assess urology residents' perceptions and attitudes toward health advocacy in residency training and practice. METHODS: We administered an anonymous, cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire to all final-year urology residents in Canadian training programs. The survey was closed-ended and employed a 5-point Likert scale. It was designed to assess familiarity with the concept of health advocacy and with its application and importance to training and practice. We used descriptive and correlative statistics to analyze the responses, such as the availability of formal training and resident participation in activities involving health advocacy. RESULTS: There was a 93% response rate among the chief residents. Most residents were well aware of the role of the health advocate in urology, and a majority (68%) believed it is important in residency training and in the urologist's role in practice. This is in stark contrast to acknowledged participation and formal training in health advocacy. A minority (7%-25%) agreed that formal training or mentorship in health advocacy was available at their institution, and only 21%-39% felt that they had used its principles in the clinic or community. Only 4%-7% of residents surveyed were aware of or had participated in local urological health advocacy groups. CONCLUSION: Despite knowledge about and acceptance of the importance of the health advocate role, there is a perceived lack of formal training and a dearth of participation during urological residency training.","Leveridge, Michael     Beiko, Darren     Wilson, James W L     Siemens, D Robert     Journal Article     Canada     Can Urol Assoc J. 2007 Nov;1(4):363-9.

A 2-day off-site chief resident immersion training (CRIT) addressed these challenges. Objectives were to foster collaboration between disciplines in the management of complex older patients, increase knowledge of geriatrics principles to incorporate into teaching, enhance leadership skills, and help CRs develop an achievable project for implementation in their CR year. Three cohorts totaling 47 trainees and 18 faculty mentors from 13 medical and surgical disciplines participated over 3 successive years. The curriculum, developed and taught by a multidisciplinary team, featured an interactive surgical case, mini-lectures on geriatrics topics, seminars to enhance teaching and leadership skills, and one-on-one mentoring to develop a project in geriatric care or education. Evaluation included pre- and postprogram tests and self-report surveys and two follow-up surveys or interviews. In 2006 and 2007, scores on a 12-item objective knowledge test increased significantly (P<.001) from before to immediately after CRIT. Self-report knowledge and confidence in teaching geriatrics also increased significantly (P<.05) in all formally covered topics. Mean enhancement of CR skills was 4.3 (1=not at all, 5=very much). Eleven months after CRIT, all but five CRs had implemented at least part of their action projects. CRs reported improved care of older patients, better leadership skills, more and better geriatrics teaching, and more collaboration between disciplines. A 2-day interactive program for CRs can increase institutional capacity regarding geriatrics teaching and care of elderly patients across medical specialties.","1532-5415     Levine, Sharon A     Chao, Serena H     Brett, Belle     Jackson, Angela H     Burrows, Adam B     Goldman, Laura N     Caruso, Lisa B     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Am Geriatr Soc. 2008 Jun;56(6):1140-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01710.x.

This study examined whether the Boston Medical Center Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) in the Care of Older Adults was replicable at diverse medical institutions. METHOD: Between 2008 and 2010, 12 institutions in 11 states received funding, technical support, and a common program model. Each implemented 2.5-day CRITs, consisting of a patient case, geriatrics-related lectures, CR leadership sessions, action project planning, and networking time. Site faculty conducted 21 CRITs for 295 CRs representing 28 specialties. CRs completed knowledge pre- and posttests, and self-report baseline and six-month follow-up surveys. Outcome measures were change in pre- and posttest score, and change from baseline to six months in self-reported surveys. RESULTS: Response rate for CRs was 99% (n = 293) for the pre-post tests and 78% (n = 231) for matchable baseline and follow-up surveys. Participants' knowledge increased from 6.32 to 8.39 (P < .001) averaged from 12 questions. CRs' self-reported ability to apply clinical problem-solving skills to older patients (P < .001), number of geriatrics topics taught (P < .001), frequency of geriatrician consultations (P = .017), confidence in leadership skills (P < .001), and confidence to conduct CR work (P < .001) increased from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: CRIT is an innovative way to give nongeriatricians knowledge and skills to treat complex older patients.","1938-808x     Levine, Sharon A     Chao, Serena H     Caruso, Lisa B     Jackson, Angela H     Russell, Matthew L     Young, Megan E     Brett, Belle     Journal Article     United States     Acad Med. 2018 Sep;93(9):1341-1347. doi: 10.1097/ACM.0000000000002311.

The questionnaire was also administered to surgery staff, and responses were compared with those from house staff. ABX use on surgery wards of a 550-bed county teaching hospital was retrospectively reviewed from January to June of 1992. Inpatients receiving at least one dose of the four most commonly ordered ABX with extended spectrum against Gram-negative bacteria were tabulated. Significant differences in the monthly percentage of use for individual ABX were observed (p < 0.05). The survey results indicated that surgery house staff felt that chief residents were the most important source of ABX information. Efficacy was the most important selection factor for staff (42% residents vs 100% staff), whereas residents felt that staff or chief resident choice were more important. When asked to rank the importance of factors to switch ABX in a patient, residents relied on returns of ABX sensitivity data whereas staff relied on a change in clinical course. In a case vignette of a 26-year-old male abdominal gun shot wound victim, 62% of residents, but 0% of staff switched ABX when exploration revealed a cecal gun shot wound with mild to moderate spillage (p < 0.05). Other responses suggested that chief residents were more likely to order extended spectrum ABX and to continue them for a longer duration. We conclude that costs and variations in ABX selection may be minimized by ongoing resident education, emphasizing the role of the chief resident.","L24045128     1994-02-18 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"
"",The effect of preparation on experience and learning in high-fidelity clinical simulation training,2018,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,33,2,361,"Lim, J.

V. and Teague, T. and Sargsyan, Z.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622329498,English,,,"Background: Benefits of simulation training in medical education have been demonstrated for both technical and cognitive skills. In simulated clinical decision-making, participants traditionally enter scenarios without prior knowledge of, or preparation for, the case. This approach aims to create adequate challenge, stress, and inquiry to promote engagement and learning. However, the effects of knowing and reviewing the general topic of the cases ahead of time are not known. We hypothesized that reviewing relevant medical knowledge prior to the simulation may enhance the trainees' experience and learning outcomes without detracting from engagement or fidelity. Methods: During an 8-week block of our institution's simulation curriculum, interns were randomized to one of two groups. Intervention group interns were provided reading materials and one hour of dedicated study time prior to encountering their simulation cases of the day (a patient experiencing chest pain from rapid atrial fibrillation, and another with hypotension from unsuspected gastrointestinal bleeding [GIB]). Control group interns were provided the same reading materials and dedicated study time, but only after completing the simulation cases. The cases were facilitated and debriefed by trained and blinded faculty or chief residents. Facilitators also assessed intern group performance with an objective checklist of critical action items and a nontechnical scorecard adapted from a previously published instrument. At the end of each session, interns completed a survey about their experience. Additional outcome measures included observed performance on similar cases 8 weeks after the intervention and scores on a written quiz taken about 6 weeks thereafter. Results: All 64 participating interns responded to survey. The intervention (preparation) group reported higher ratings of the overall quality of the educational experience compared to the control group (3.8 vs. 3.5 on a scale of 0-4, p=0.04). There was no difference in enjoyment (3.4 vs. 3.2, p = 0.20) or stress (1.7 vs. 1.8, p=0.31) of the simulation cases. The intervention group reported higher discussion of communication skills in the debriefing sessions (3.2 vs 2.6, p=0.02). Performance onsimulated cases on the day of intervention aswell as 8 weeks later was similar between the two groups, with the exception of higher checklist scores in the initial GIB case in the preparation group (14.7 vs 12.7 of 21 items, p< 0.01). Written quiz performance scores were similar (16.8 vs. 17 of 25 questions, p = 0.89). Conclusions: Preparing prior to simulation cases, as compared with the standard educational practice of participating without preparation, was associated with higher overall rating of educational value, without decrement in other metrics of learner experience, or in learner outcomes. More investigation, including with different content and in different institutions, is needed on the topic.","L622329498     2018-05-31

METHODS: The authors mailed a survey about the roles and responsibilities of chief resident positions to psychiatric residency training directors using the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training (AADPRT) mailing list in 1995 and e-mailed the AADPRT e-mail list in 2006. Data were collected by mail in 1995 and collected in 2006 by a web-based survey similar to the instrument used in 1995. RESULTS: Joint selection of chief resident by faculty and residents, 12-month terms, protected time for administrative duties, and written job descriptions were helpful features common to most programs.

B.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to determine the impact of an endovascular program (EVP) on open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) operations in a residency training institution. METHODS: Over an 8-year period ending in September 2001, hospital records of all patients undergoing open or endovascular AAA repair were retrospectively reviewed. Data were analyzed to determine the changing patterns of case volume, type of operative repair, and complexity of open repair with regards to the training of both general surgical chief residents and vascular fellows. RESULTS: A total of 849 AAA operations were performed during the study period. The initiation of the EVP in 1997 resulted in a steady increase in the total annual AAA cases (P < 0.05), due in part to an increase in endovascular AAA operations despite a decrease in the annual open AAA volume. EVP had a positive impact on the overall operative experience of vascular fellows owing to the large increase in their endovascular AAA experience (annual mean pre-EVP 3 +/- 0.8 versus post-EVP 47 +/- 9.6, P < 0.01). A significant reduction occurred in the vascular fellows' open AAA experience (annual mean pre-EVP 40 +/- 12.7 versus post-EVP 19 +/- 9.4, P < 0.05). EVP did not affect the endovascular AAA experience of general surgery chief residents (annual mean pre-EVP 1 +/- 0.8 versus post-EVP 3 +/- 1.5, not significant). A significant reduction occurred in chief residents' open AAA experience (annual mean pre-EVP 39 +/- 9.7 versus post-EVP 18 +/- 7.4, P < 0.05). EVP did not affect the operative experience of complex open AAA operations in either vascular fellows or general surgery residents. CONCLUSIONS: An endovascular program has a positive impact on the aortic aneurysm practice in an academic institution, as evidenced by the significant increase in annual endovascular AAA cases despite a decrease in open AAA operations. Although vascular fellows continued to maintain sufficient experience in both open and endovascular AAA operations, general surgery chief residents suffered a significant decrease in their open AAA experience. Further evaluation of the residency system is warranted to better optimize the training paradigm of both vascular fellowship and general surgery residency.","Lin, Peter H     Bush, Ruth L     Milas, Mira     Terramani, Thomas T     Dodson, Thomas F     Chen, Changyi     Chaikof, Elliot L     Lumsden, Alan B     Journal Article     United States     Am J Surg. 2003 Aug;186(2):189-93.

A., 3rd and Capozzi, A.",,eng,,,"The field of plastic and reconstructive surgery continues to broaden its scope while other fields continue to narrow theirs. The inability to teach aesthetic surgery is often confounded by the absence of an aesthetic surgery clinic for the chief resident, a reduced number of procedures and cases available, and a lack of faculty staff involvement. A close examination of the 19 western United States-based plastic surgery programs was performed in order to determine the most useful methods in teaching aesthetic surgery. An aesthetic surgery survey was distributed to most recently graduated plastic surgery residents to evaluate their overall experience in aesthetic surgery during residency. Of the 40 residents' surveys, 31 were returned. As anticipated, greater than half (51.6%) of the western United States programs were without a chief resident aesthetic clinic. Also, greater than half of those surveyed (51.6%) felt that the quantity of aesthetic cases was insufficient. The residents' comfort in performing specific operations was quite variable. From data analysis it is apparent there is a greater requirement for ""hands-on"" experience with aesthetic surgical cases during residency training. Overwhelmingly, the responses indicated the need for a Chief Resident Aesthetic Clinic, greater faculty involvement, and an increased clinic population with attending staff assistance. A 6-month chief resident aesthetic surgery clinic rotation at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital has proven to be very beneficial in teaching all aspects including pre-operative evaluation, surgical technique, and postoperative care of the aesthetic patient.","Linder, S A     Mele, J A 3rd     Capozzi, A     Journal Article     United States     Aesthetic Plast Surg. 1996 Jul-Aug;20(4):351-4.

C. and Petkova, E. and Shatkin, J.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Mentorship is an important component of graduate education. This study assessed the perceptions of general psychiatry chief residents regarding the adequacy of mentorship provided during training. METHODS: The authors surveyed 229 chief residents participating in the APA National Chief Residents Leadership Program in 2004 and 2005. The survey assessed domains such as work hours, didactics, home and family life, and mentorship. RESULTS: Of the chief psychiatric residents surveyed, 49% reported that they did not have a clearly defined career development mentor, and 39% reported that they did not feel adequately mentored. Gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, moonlighting, medical school (American versus international), and type of residency program (academic versus community based) did not show significant association with either ""having a clearly defined mentor"" or ""feeling adequately mentored,"" based on chi-squared tests for independence. Chief residents who had authored peer-reviewed publications were significantly more likely to report having a clearly defined mentor and to feel adequately mentored than those who did not author publications. Logistic regression analysis showed that having a clearly defined mentor was associated with twice the odds for feeling well prepared to practice psychiatry upon graduation compared with those who did not have a clearly defined mentor, even after controlling for gender, race, medical school, and residency program type. CONCLUSION: Half of the psychiatric chief residents surveyed reported the lack of a clearly defined career development mentor. In addition, a chief resident's response of lacking a clear mentor was associated with the perception of being less prepared to practice psychiatry upon graduation. Psychiatric residency training programs may benefit from further clarification and implementation of effective mentorship programs.","1545-7230     Lis, Lea DeFrancisci     Wood, William C     Petkova, Eva     Shatkin, Jess     Journal Article     United States     Acad Psychiatry. 2009 Jul-Aug;33(4):307-12. doi: 10.1176/appi.ap.33.4.307.

Level of rater-student contact was, however, related to accuracy, with the most accurate ratings based upon discussion of seven to eleven patients. Low levels of contact were associated with overly stringent ratings, and high levels of contact were associated with lenient ratings.

Recorded attendance at these conferences was lower than expected and observed. Morning and Noon Conference average recorded attendance for the 2014-2015 academic year were 5.4 and 7.5, respectively. In addition, residency coordinators were spending significant time entering the data into Medhub for tracking purposes. AIM STATEMENT: Increase recorded conference attendance by 100% in 2015 during 3 month period when compared to the same time period in 2014. INTERVENTIONS: Chief Residents and Residency Coordinators at Stanford evaluated multiple different methods of recording attendance at conferences. Electronic badging was chosen for ease of use and compatibility with MedHub for direct uploading of attendance into MedHub. Each resident was given a specific Quick Response Code placed on their hospital ID that was linked to Medhub. An iPad was loaded with codeReadr software and was placed at the door for each morning and noon conference. Residents scanned their code, which automatically recorded attendance in MedHub. The scanner would prevent anyone from recording attendance if they arrived more than 50% of the way through the conference. Conference attendance data was recorded four days a week for three months (Sept 15-Dec 15) and compared to the previous three months (Jun 15-Sept 15) before the intervention and to the same time period the previous academic year (Sept 14-Dec 14). MEASURES: Measures include number of recorded attendees at each conference and average conference attendance. RESULTS: After the intervention, average Morning Conference recorded attendance increased by 43% (p-value <0.005), and Noon Conference recorded attendance increased by 16% (0.02). When comparing the average recorded conference attendance from the same time period in the 2014 versus 2015 academic year, Morning Conference attendance increased by 9.7 residents a 287% increase(<0.005) and Noon Conference increased by 7.2 a 115% increase(<0.005). CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS: There was a significant increase in recorded attendance at both Morning and Noon Conference after implementation of electronic attendance tracking. Manually entering attendance data into MedHub was also eliminated from a coordinators tasks. More data needs to be collected to measure sustainability of increase and expansion to all conferences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A telephone interview was conducted with 213 chief residents and 11 other senior residents representing all 224 accredited residency programs in diagnostic radiology. RESULTS: Compared with 1990, more programs had exclusive mammography rotations (74% versus 40%). The number of fellowships in breast imaging increased from 17 to 76. More training programs differentiated screening from diagnostic examinations (50% versus 35%). Compared with 1992, the percentage of residents who knew recommended frequencies of quality control procedures increased by 30% and the percentage who knew the maximum allowable radiation dose increased by 50%. Residents lacked fundamental knowledge about conducting medical audits, such as calculating the positive predictive value for biopsies. CONCLUSION: More time is being devoted to breast imaging in diagnostic radiology residency training, and residents show greater knowledge about mammography quality assurance.","Lubisich, J P     Bassett, L W     Bresch, J A     Jessop, N W     U50/CCU306167/PHS HHS/United States     Comparative Study     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

PURPOSE: The objective was to improve morning report through a toolkit combining principles of learning theory with resident teaching. METHODS: The toolkit consists of three parts: a guideline describing expectations, a worksheet outlining teaching plans, and a feedback form facilitating post-presentation feedback. In 2009-2010, internal medicine residents met with a chief resident before their presentations to refine teaching plans. The chief resident then supported the presenter in achieving their objectives and provided post-presentation feedback. Residents were surveyed before and 6 months after the intervention. Mean scores were compared using an unpaired t test. RESULTS: Residents' ratings improved in the following domains: understanding expectations (3.10 vs. 4.02, p = .0003), presentation organization (3.50 vs. 4.25, p = .005), and creating and accomplishing learning objectives (3.31 vs. 4.00, p = .002).

The purpose of this study was to determine the preferred maintenance surveillance practices of high SCI patients (T4/5) from the perspective of chief urology residents. Methods: A 14-question survey was administered at the QUEST chief resident preparation examination in 2017. Topics included: imaging modality, laboratory testing, and procedures related to upper and lower tract surveillance. Data was de-identified and participation was voluntary. Results: All candidates completed a single questionnaire. Chief residents encountered high SCI patients in either diverse clinical settings, including rehabilitation centres, or single practitioner clinics, or solely as hospital inpatients. Candidates had similar surveillance management algorithms for stable patients with neurogenic voiding dysfunction of: yearly followup with a serum creatinine and upper urinary tract ultrasound. The performance of surveillance cystoscopy in stable patients with neurogenic voiding dysfunction and long-term, indwelling catheter had varied responses. The final question asked how comfortable residents were with managing high SCI patients; 42% responded they were comfortable, while the rest responded that they were either neutral, uncomfortable, or very uncomfortable. Conclusions: Most chief residents made similar surveillance decisions for high SCI patients, however, they differed on the frequency of cystoscopy and how comfortable they were managing this patient population. Comfortable or not, the decisions chief residents made regarding surveillance were performed in the acute care setting and not in the outpatient setting. In the era of competency-based medical education, this information can be used to highlight training opportunities and improvements for this patient population.","L623020718     2018-07-18 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

R.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has been performed in Rochester, NY, since 2003. Currently, 10 area urologists perform RARP, and robotic training has become an important component of the residency. We present data describing the timeline for adoption, both in clinical practice and in the residency program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the operating logs for all surgeons who were performing prostatectomies in all hospitals in Rochester, NY, from 2003 to 2007. We examined the influence RARP had on other treatments, including brachytherapy and cryotherapy. Surgical logs of graduating chief residents were also reviewed. RESULTS: Eleven surgeons in Rochester regularly perform radical prostatectomy (10 perform primarily RARP, one performs only open prostatectomy). Three of the city's four hospitals have robotic systems. In 2003-2004, there were 30 open prostatectomies performed monthly and fewer than 10 performed robotically. By 2006, the trend was reversed, with 50 robot-assisted prostatectomies performed each month and fewer than 10 open prostatectomies (P<0.05). The rate of brachytherapy fluctuated, increasing in centers without a robot. The number of open prostatectomies in centers without a robot dropped significantly to fewer than 10 cases per year. There was also a significant decrease in the number of open prostatectomies performed by chief residents. CONCLUSIONS: Since the introduction of surgical robotics, significant changes have been seen. The volume of radical prostatectomies performed by surgeons at institutions with robotics has increased; the volume at robot-free institutions has become nominal. There is a trend toward increased radiation therapy at robot-free institutions. While radical prostatectomies logged by graduating chief residents have increased, open prostatectomy experience is now minimal.","1557-900x     Madeb, Ralph     Golijanin, Dragan     Knopf, Joy K     Kowalczyk, John     Feng, Changyong     Rashid, Hani     Wu, Guan     Eichel, Louis     Valvo, John R     Journal Article     United States     J Endourol. 2011 Apr;25(4):573-7. doi: 10.1089/end.2010.0498.

DESIGN: The study was designed in a prospective randomized fashion. All patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy were asked for consent. Consenters were assigned randomly to group A (attending directed) or group B (senior resident directed). In group A, all laparoscopic appendectomies were performed by junior residents (PGY-1, -2, or -3) with the attending faculty as the assistant. In group B, all cases were performed by junior residents (PGY-1, -2, or -3) with the chief resident or PGY-4 acting as a teaching assistant. The allocation sequence was generated before the study by random permutations of 120 assignments, 60 to each arm. The study ended after 60 laparoscopic appendectomies were recorded in each arm. SETTING: The study was conducted at San Joaquin General Hospital. This 200-bed, county teaching hospital has sponsored the general surgery residency program for the past 60 years. RESULTS: No significant difference in duration of surgery, hospital stay, postoperative complication, or baseline values was found between group A (attending faculty) or group B (senior resident).

In this study, we investigated factors associated with test results to determine whether residents at risk of not passing the ABSCE can be identified a priori. DESIGN: All general surgery chief residents who graduated from a large academic/community program between 2001 and 2010 were identified. Residents who did not pass the ABSCE on the first attempt were compared to a control group of chief residents who passed the examination on the first attempt. Evaluation metrics included ""knowledge,"" ""professional communication,"" and ""spoken English"" scores. Differences between groups were determined using one-way ANOVA and chi(2) calculations. RESULTS: Over the decade, 13 residents made more than 1 attempt to pass the ABSCE. The element of the ""knowledge"" score associated with ABSCE first-attempt pass rates included United States medical licensing examination (USMLE) Step 2 scores (p = 0.02), and not ABSITE, American Board of Surgery Qualifying examination (ABSQE)/written examination or USMLE Step 1 scores. ""Professional communication"" scores associated with first-attempt pass rates included in-house mock oral examination scores (p = 0.01) and Citywide mock oral examination scores (p = 0.02). ABSCE pass rates did not differ in native vs. non-native English speakers or graduation from a United States vs. International medical school. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a control group of residents from the same program, residents who passed the ABSCE examination on the first attempt were more likely to have higher USMLE Step 2 and professional communication scores. USMLE Step 1 scores and English as a native language were not associated with certifying examination pass rates. These criteria may offer guidance for residents preparing to take the ABSCE and may aid in the selection of residents for residency programs. Larger studies to validate these findings and to investigate the role of improving communication skills and conducting interventions between the 1st and 2nd attempt are warranted.","1878-7452     Maker, Vijay K     Zahedi, Marco M     Villines, Dana     Maker, Ajay V     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2012 Nov-Dec;69(6):705-13. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2012.08.009.

In this paper, we assessed the current level of resident education in IMRT in the United States. Chief residents at all 77 accredited radiation oncology programs were sent a 13-question survey addressing formal didactics and hands-on experience in IMRT. The survey assessed the frequency, subject, and format of IMRT didactics. Questions also addressed the number of IMRT patients and anatomical sites treated, resident involvement in the IMRT process, and the intent of IMRT use. Finally, residents were asked for their opinions on their IMRT education. Sixty-one surveys (79%) were completed. Overall, forty-three respondents (71%) reported receiving formal IMRT didactics, with nearly one-third reporting extensive didactics (> or = 3 lectures/seminars et cetera per year). The most common didactic formats were lectures (95%) and journal clubs (63%), most commonly supervised by physicists (98%). Involvement by physicians and radiobiologists were reported by 63% and 7% of respondents, respectively. Overall, 87% of respondents had hands-on IMRT training, with nearly one-half having treated > 25 patients. The most common sites treated were head and neck (94%) and prostate (81%). Involvement in all aspects of the IMRT process was common, particularly target and tissue delineation (98%) and plan evaluation (93%). Most respondents (79%) with hands-on experience reported receiving formal didactics. However, nearly one-third received no or only minimal formal didactics. The percentage of respondents desiring increased IMRT didactics and hands-on experience were 70% and 47%, respectively. Our results suggest that the great majority of radiation oncology residents in the United States are currently exposed to didactics and hands-on training in IMRT.

Little, however, is known about the extent to which psychiatry programs integrate this evidence base into residency training or the methods by which this is accomplished. Psychiatry residency program directors and chief residents participated in an exploratory online survey to establish how psychosocial factors known to impact medication outcomes are integrated into psychopharmacology education. While participants highly valued the importance of psychosocial factors in the prescribing process, there was limited emphasis of these factors in psychopharmacology training. Additionally, some teaching methods that could advance understanding of complex interactions in the psychopharmacology relationship were found to be underutilized. Given that medication outcomes are significantly influenced by psychosocial factors, psychiatric educators have a responsibility to teach residents about the evidence base available. Residents exposed to this evidence base will be better equipped to manage the complexities of the psychopharmacology role.

We have adopted a resident driven structured bedside teaching curriculum that allows students to teach one another on a busy general surgery service. The aim of this study was to see the effect of using a structured educational teaching curriculum on the NBME shelf examinations. METHODS: On daily bedside teaching rounds, 30 common surgical topics were randomized and presented by medical students and a single chief resident. Pre-clerkship and post-clerkship test questions were applied. The mean scores on the NBME Surgery Shelf examinations were compared between students utilizing this teaching curriculum and those without it. Students' satisfaction with curriculum content, ease of presentation preparations, effectiveness as a learning tool and fairness of the test questions were also assessed. Data analysis was by student t-test for continuous data and chi-square test for categorical data. RESULTS: A total of 45 third-year medical students participated in the study. The mean score on the post-clerkship examinations were increased when compared to the pretest scores (65.5 vs 43.0; p<0.0001). The mean NBME scores were significantly higher in the students that underwent the teaching curriculum when compared to their peers that were not exposed to the teaching curriculum (78 vs 72; p<0.006). 95-98% of the medical students were satisfied with the teaching curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a resident driven structured bedside teaching curriculum improves performance of medical students on the General Surgery NBME shelf examinations.","L71167454     2013-09-23

"",are you updated? using a signout audit tool to address ACGME milestones and entrustable professional activities in patient hand offs,2013,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,28,,S487,"Martin, S. K. and Paesch, E. A. and Farnan, J. M. and Espel, J. and McConville, J. and Arora, V.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71293769,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: ACGME Milestones and Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) have emerged as benchmarks for housestaff professional development. Residents must demonstrate expertise in these patient care activities in order to progress in training, and thus programs will require tools for direct observation in order to evaluate these skills. These tools must evaluate milestone-specific performance in a manner that can provide both summative and formative feedback in a timely fashion. We report the use of one such tool, the UPDATED signout audit tool, to evaluate ACGME milestones related to handoffs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This intervention occurred with interns in the internal medicine residency program at the University of Chicago, an academic medical center whose electronic health record features an electronic signout. This is a document generated from a template that partially automates some fields using information from the electronic chart (e.g. patient medications). Other information must be entered in free-text form (e.g., hospital course and tasks for overnight care). DESCRIPTION: The UPDATED audit tool was used to evaluate electronic signouts done by internal medicine interns on non-critical care internal medicine services. This tool emphasizes several key areas reflected in ACGME milestones, including ensuring accurate documentation (ICS-F1, P-A1), appropriate synthesis and definition of clinical problems (PC-C1) and effective communication during transitions of care (ICS-C1). All 45 interns were assigned independent review of two electronic signouts from July-October by one of eight faculty auditors (4 chief residents and 4 hospitalists). Seven items specific signout attributes were scored, and an overall score of 0 to 9 was assigned. Audits scoring 0-3 were categorized as Poor, 4-6 as Fair, and 7- 9 as Good. Ratings among faculty members were compared for consensus. EVALUATION: Of the 45 interns, 32 had complete audits, 6 partial audits, and 7 were unable to be audited during the initial period. Interns were identified for immediate feedback if they received two Fair scores or one Poor score. If signoutswere unable to be fully audited or received at least one Fair score, interns were assigned additional review in subsequent months. Signouts were considered satisfactory if both audits were scored as Good. Of the 32 completed audits, 16 % (n=5) of interns were identified for immediate feedback, and 41 % (n=19) for additional future review. The remaining interns (44 %) were satisfactory. Audits were incorporated into intern semi-annual performance reviews within the housestaff evaluation committee. Interns achieving a satisfactory audit were designated as Competent, those awaiting further review as Undergoing further evaluation of competence, and those flagged for immediate feedback as Received immediate feedback and undergoing further evaluation of competence. The 13 interns not fully audited were designated as Waiting to be evaluated. A second round of audits will be done from December-April. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: The UDPATED Signout Audit Tool is a feasible and effective way to use direct observation to address resident achievement of competency in ACGME milestones related to handoffs. The tool is a useful way to incorporate milestones in evaluation of housestaff readiness to progress in training and is well-suited to be included as an assessment for the proposed EPA encompassing patient handoffs, Managing Transitions of Care.","L71293769     2014-01-28 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

All operations were performed for cancer, with a stapler being used for bronchial suture. The patients were classified in three groups according to the surgeon: 133 (38%) were operated by an University professor (group I, 2 surgeons), 171 (49%) by chief resident or hospital practitioner (group II, 3 surgeons) and 44 (13%) by an intern (group III, 14 surgeons). The homogeneity of the 3 groups was checked with alpha X2 test. The study dealt with the overall mortality as well as with the specific complications of pneumonia, namely empyema and bronchopleural fistulae. The overall postoperative mortality rate was similar in the 3 groups (respectively 8%, 8% and 5%), as well as the occurrence of empyema (respectively 4%, 3% and 5%). A difference that, though not significant statistically, is not negligible, appears for bronchopleural fistulae, which complicate 9% of the operations carried out by interns vs. 4% in the other 2 categories. These observations challenge a number of studies claiming that surgery performed by inexperienced surgeons is innocuous. However, pneumonectomy is an essential step in the training to thoracic surgery, so that no candidate with sufficient surgical maturity should be prevented from performing it.","Massard, G     Roeslin, N     Wihlm, J M     Dumont, P     Lion, R     Witz, J P     Morand, G     English Abstract     Journal Article     France     J Chir (Paris). 1991 Mar;128(3):116-9.

RESULTS: Increased direct observation is associated with the perception of more accurate knowledge, which is associated with increased feedback. Some evaluators provide feedback in the absence of accurate knowledge of a trainee's performance, and others who have accurate knowledge miss opportunities for feedback.

There is a growing concern that the pendulum has now shifted too far toward MIS and that current general surgery residents' exposure to open abdominal procedures is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze trends in open vs MIS intra-abdominal procedures performed by residents graduating from US general surgery residency programs over the past twelve years. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the data from the ACGME national resident case log reports for graduating US general surgery residents from 2000 to 2011. We analyzed the average number of cases per graduating chief resident for the following surgical procedures: appendectomy, inguinal/femoral hernia repair, gastrostomy, colectomy, antireflux procedures, and cholecystectomy. RESULTS: For all the procedures analyzed, except antireflux procedures, a statistically significant increase in the number of MIS cases was seen. The increases in MIS procedures were as follows: appendectomy, 8.5 to 46 (542%); inguinal/femoral hernia repair, 7.6 to 23.3 (265%); gastrostomy, 1.4 to 3 (114%); colectomy, 1.8 to 18.2 (1011%); and cholecystectomy, 84 to 105.7 (26%). The p value was set at <0.001 for all procedures. There has been a concomitant decrease in the number of open procedures. The numbers of open appendectomy decreased from 30.9 to 15.5 (p < 0.0001), open inguinal/femoral hernia repair from 52.1 to 48 (p = 0.0038), open gastrostomy from 7.7 to 4.9 (p = 0.0094), open colectomy from 48 to 40.7 (p < 0.0001), open cholecystectomy from 15.5 to 10.4 (p = 0.0005), and open antireflux procedures from 4.7 to 1.7 (p < 0.001). An analysis conducted over time reveals that the rates of increase in MIS procedures in 5 of the 6 categories continue to rise, whereas the rates of open appendectomy, open colectomy, and open antireflux procedures continue to decrease. However, the rates of decline of open hernia repairs and open gastrostomies seem to have plateaued. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of open procedures in general surgery residency has declined significantly in the past 12 years. The effect of the decline in open cases in surgical training and practice remains to be determined.","1878-7452     McCoy, Andrew C     Gasevic, Enej     Szlabick, Randolph E     Sahmoun, Abe E     Sticca, Robert P     Comparative Study     Evaluation Studies     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2013 Nov-Dec;70(6):683-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2013.09.002.

L.",,eng,,,"Physician supply factors are based on a number of variables. These include the base supply and retirements, which presently show that around 200 urologists are retiring per year. Death rates of both patients and physicians are significant. The rate of entry of graduating residents is important. Population changes (which certainly will continue to increase in the United States) are important. Needs-based projections, demand-needs based projections, and benchmarked projections are important issues. The immigration of physicians is important. So far, I think we have seen little emigration of physicians from the United States. A number of confounding variables can have impact and are almost impossible to predict at present. These include technology changes, disease patterns, and methods of care delivery. The Strategic Planning Committee thought we should aim for a band of 200 to 250 chief residents finishing one per year. We have already reached the 250 level. At 200 finishing per year, we would have 2300 fewer urologists in the year 2020 than we presently have. AT 225/year, we would have 1700 fewer urologists. At 250 (our present level), we will have 1100 fewer than now. These 8800 urologists would be caring for 60 million more patients, of whom 20 million would be Medicare patients. These patients would provide over 500 additional patient visits/year/urologist. I hope that I have convinced you that the system is correcting and responding to multiple market forces.

17411968,Radiology residency call: residents' perceptions of the on-call experience,2005,1,1,J Am Coll Radiol,1558-349X (Electronic)     1546-1440 (Linking),2,11,932-8,"McDonald, J. M. and Berbaum, K. and Bennett, D. L. and Mullan, B.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: This paper focuses on specific resident perceptions of call, including the compliance of training programs with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME) resident work rules and the level of comfort residents have in contacting out-of-house staff radiologists for help during on-call hours. METHODS: The authors designed a Web-based survey to examine radiology residents' perceptions about call conditions with input from the 2003-2004 ACR Resident and Fellow Section Executive Council. The survey instrument was distributed to chief residents in the United States and Canada with the help of the ACR. RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of respondents felt that the amounts of work and responsibility required for call were appropriate to their levels of training. Ninety-eight percent of US respondents felt that their programs were in complete compliance with the ACGME's resident work guidelines. Eighty-nine percent were comfortable contacting the staff physicians on call when those staff physicians were out of the hospital. Respondents who felt uncomfortable calling their staff physicians were more likely to feel that the work and responsibility of call were excessive to their levels of training (chi(2) = 11.301, P = .0033). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of residents indicated that they were adequately trained for call. Most residents were on call without in-house staff coverage but felt comfortable contacting on-call staff physicians if needed. Residents who felt uncomfortable contacting on-call staff physicians were more likely to feel that their training had not prepared them for call. A high percentage of radiology resident programs are in compliance with the ACGME's resident work guidelines.","1558-349x     McDonald, Joshua M     Berbaum, Kevin     Bennett, D Lee     Mullan, Brian     Journal Article     United States     J Am Coll Radiol. 2005 Nov;2(11):932-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jacr.2005.06.007.

R.",,eng,,,"The evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) can be difficult because of the subtle manifestations of the injuries and because assessment is hampered by altered neurologic status. Short of laparotomy, CT and diagnostic peritoneal lavage provided the best means of accurately diagnosing intra-abdominal injury. Ultrasound (US) has recently been introduced into trauma centers in the United States as a quick, cheap, and safe method to make the diagnosis of BAT. After theoretical and practical training, one attending surgeon and one chief resident began performing trauma ultrasounds at a rural, Level 1 trauma center. The US was performed concurrent with initial resuscitation and prior to other studies. The US was then correlated with the other tests. Of the 82 tests performed, 79 correlated with other methods of diagnosis. Overall, US was 88 per cent sensitive, 98 per cent specific, and 96 per cent accurate in diagnosing intra-abdominal injuries. There were no operative sequelae to patients whose injury was missed by US. We conclude that: 1) US can be used as the initial method of diagnosis of BAT and 2) surgeons are able to perform the examination accurately.","McElveen, T S     Collin, G R     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Am Surg. 1997 Feb;63(2):184-8.

18063280,The impact of a formal minimally invasive service on the resident's ability to achieve new ACGME guidelines for laparoscopy,2007,1,1,J Surg Educ,1878-7452,64,6,420-3,"McFadden, C. L. and Cobb, W. S. and Lokey, J. S. and Cull, D. L. and Smith, D. E. and Taylor, S. M.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: As laparoscopy continues to permeate general surgery, there is an increased need for residents to acquire advanced laparoscopic skills during a surgical training program. To underscore its importance, the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) recently increased the requirements for laparoscopy from 34 to 60 basic cases and from 0 to 25 advanced cases. With this in mind, the purpose of this study is to assess the impact of an organized minimally invasive surgical service on the volume of advanced laparoscopic cases of a general surgery residency program. METHODS: In July 2005 an independent minimally invasive surgical service, consisting of a fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon and 3 general surgery residents was instituted in an otherwise stable academic general surgery residency program. A retrospective review of the general resident's operative database was performed from 2001 to 2006 to assess the impact of this service on the volume of advanced laparoscopic cases of graduating chief residents. RESULTS: In the 4 years before the initiation of the minimally invasive service, the operative volume remained flat despite a stable training program and steady population growth. In the year after the formation of the dedicated service, the mean number of advanced cases performed by the graduating chief residents more than doubled, from 17.7 cases in each of the 2 years before, to 35.6 cases, fulfilling the ACGME requirements. CONCLUSION: The number of advanced laparoscopic cases per resident in this otherwise stable general surgery residency program substantially increased with the incorporation of a dedicated minimally invasive service led by a fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon. These data suggest that the volume increases needed to satisfy ACGME requirements may only be possible by creation of such a training experience dedicated to advanced laparoscopy.","McFadden, Cedrek L     Cobb, William S     Lokey, Jonathan S     Cull, David L     Smith, Dane E     Taylor, Spence M     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2007 Nov-Dec;64(6):420-3. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2007.06.013.

16093153,Surgical caseload in army general surgery programs: a 10-year retrospective,2002,1,1,Curr Surg,0149-7944 (Print)     0149-7944,59,3,307-12,"McGuigan, R. M. and Beitler, A. L.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: Over the past decade, the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) has been affected by a military-wide drawdown. The volume and acuity of patients appears to be declining, raising questions regarding quantity and quality in Army surgical training programs. The purpose of this study is to examine the caseloads of Army general surgery programs compared with national averages, and to compare the board examination performance of Army residents with national pass rates. METHODS: The program directors of all 6 Army training programs were requested to submit resident caseloads and performance on qualifying and certifying examinations from 1990 to 2000. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Surgery (ABS) provided resident statistics summaries and board examination statistics, respectively, for the same period. Total caseloads, chief resident cases, performance in defined categories, and board pass rates of military residents were compared with national averages. RESULTS: Four of the 6 programs submitted the requested data. The average caseload for Army residents, both total and chief residents, has been lower than the national average over the past decade. Nationally, total case numbers have gradually increased while military changes have been variable. The number of chief resident cases has trended steadily downward in Army programs at a rate exceeding the national average. The volume of procedures in endoscopy, thoracic, and breast surgery in the Army generally exceeds those recorded outside of the military. Despite the decline in surgical cases in the military, the pass rates in both the certifying and qualifying examinations among Army graduates have been consistently higher than the national average. CONCLUSIONS: Residents who train in Army programs perform fewer operative cases than do their counterparts in civilian programs. The downward trend in the number of chief resident cases over the last 10 years is likely reflective of the changes in military medicine. Despite these trends, Army residency graduates continue to exceed national performance averages on the ABS qualifying and certifying examinations.","McGuigan, Rebecca Marier     Beitler, Alan L     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2002 May-Jun;59(3):307-12.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A one-page survey regarding research requirements during residency was mailed to the 203 program directors of accredited diagnostic radiology residency programs. Chief residents from programs that had not responded to the survey were interviewed at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Data collected were analyzed by using Pearson's chi 2 test. RESULTS: Ninety-two residency programs responded to the survey. Residents were required to assist a faculty member with research in 33% of programs and perform independent research in 20%. There was no statistically significant difference between private practice-based and university-based training programs. A total of 53% of residency programs required some type of resident research. Defined rotations in research were less common (14%). Time off for research activity was granted on request in 23% of the programs. Programs that did not require research used voluntary research activity (25%) and teaching opportunities (17%) to meet the scholarly activity requirement. CONCLUSION: While there is no specific ACGME requirement for research by residents, data indicate that the majority of programs consider research activity, either independent or by assisting faculty, to fulfill the ACGME scholarly activity requirement. However, no single method was selected by more than 33% of those responding.","McGuire, C W     Herberman, H B     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 1998 Oct;5(10):698-700.

T.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with increased research productivity, satisfaction, and perceived barriers to research within residency from the experience of pediatric chief residents. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was administered to academic year 2014-15 chief residents. Topics assessed included program demographic characteristics, career intentions, research productivity, satisfaction with research training and opportunities, and research barriers. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used for descriptive statistics. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with productivity and research satisfaction. RESULTS: The response rate was 63% (165 of 261). Half (82 of 165) were productive in research. Most were satisfied with their quality of research training (55%; 90 of 165) and research opportunities (69%; 114 of 165). Chiefs reporting interest in research were 5 times more likely to be productive than those who did not (odds ratio [OR] = 5.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-11.8). Productive chiefs were more likely to report including research time in future careers (P = .003). Most (83%; 137 of 165) thought their programs were supportive of resident research, but lack of time was frequently cited as a major barrier. Those satisfied with research opportunities were less likely to find lack of training (OR = 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7) or faculty mentorship (OR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.0-0.9) as a major barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric chief resident interest in research is strongly associated with research productivity during residency, and research productivity is strongly associated with career plans including research time. By cultivating research interest through faculty mentorship, research training, and dedicated time, pediatric residency programs might help foster early research success and, potentially lead to continued engagement with research in trainees' future careers.","1876-2867     McHenry, Megan S     Abramson, Erika L     McKenna, Michael P     Li, Su-Ting T     Journal Article     United States     Acad Pediatr. 2017 Mar;17(2):144-148. doi: 10.1016/j.acap.2016.09.010.

To evaluate the impact of these changes on aesthetic training, a survey was sent to residents and program directors. METHODS: A 37 question survey was sent to plastic surgery residents at all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-approved plastic surgery training programs in the United States. A 13 question survey was sent to the program directors at the same institutions. Both surveys were analyzed to determine the duration of training and comfort level with cosmetic procedures. RESULTS: Eighty-three residents (10%) and 11 program directors (11%) completed the survey. Ninety-four percentage of residents had a dedicated cosmetic surgery rotation (an increase from 68% in 2015) in addition to a resident cosmetic clinic. Twenty percentage of senior residents felt they would need an aesthetic surgery fellowship to practice cosmetic surgery compared with 31% in 2015. Integrated chief residents were more comfortable performing cosmetic surgery cases compared with independent chief residents. Senior residents continue to have poor confidence with facial aesthetic and body contouring procedures. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increase in dedicated cosmetic surgery rotations and fewer residents believe they need a fellowship to practice cosmetic surgery. However, the comfort level of performing facial aesthetic and body contouring procedures remains low particularly among independent residents.","McNichols, Colton H L     Diaconu, Silviu     Alfadil, Sara     Woodall, Jhade     Grant, Michael     Lifchez, Scott     Nam, Arthur     Rasko, Yvonne     Journal Article     United States     Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open. 2017 Sep 26;5(9):e1491. doi: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001491. eCollection 2017 Sep.

Despite the importance of this relationship, few studies have explored the characteristics of an effective program director-chief resident partnership or how to facilitate collaboration between the 2 roles, which collectively are important to program quality and resident satisfaction. We describe the development and impact of a novel workshop that paired program directors with their incoming chief residents to facilitate improved partnerships. METHODS: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education sponsored a full-day workshop for residency program directors and their incoming chief residents. Sessions focused on increased understanding of personality styles, using experiential learning, and open communication between chief residents and program directors, related to feedback and expectations of each other. Participants completed an anonymous survey immediately after the workshop and again 8 months later to assess its long-term impact. RESULTS: Participants found the workshop to be a valuable experience, with comments revealing common themes. Program directors and chief residents expect each other to act as a role model for the residents, be approachable and available, and to be transparent and fair in their decision-making processes; both groups wanted feedback on performance and clear expectations from each other for roles and responsibilities; and both groups identified the need to be innovative and supportive of changes in the program. Respondents to the follow-up survey reported that workshop participation improved their relationships with their co-chiefs and program directors. CONCLUSION: Participation in this experiential workshop improved the working relationships between chief residents and program directors. The themes that were identified can be used to foster communication between incoming chief residents and residency directors and to develop a curriculum for chief resident development.","1949-8357     McPhillips, Heather A     Frohna, John G     Murad, M Hassan     Batra, Maneesh     Panda, Mukta     Miller, Marsha A     Brigham, Timothy P     Doughty, Robert A     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2011 Dec;3(4):593-7. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-10-00226.1.

METHODS: Chief residents of psychiatry training programs across the United States (response rate 59%) anonymously completed questions on what and how the care of suicidal patients was taught. Topics that required more attention and barriers to teaching were also identified. RESULTS: A vast majority of the national programs (91%) offered formal teaching on suicide care; grand rounds (85%) and case conferences (80%) were also popular methods for teaching. Even the topics most commonly taught, such as risk factors, recognizing early warning signs, and standards of clinical care, were judged to warrant more attention by many residents. Commonly identified barriers to teaching included the lack of audio or video teaching materials and relevant texts. Only 19% of chief residents reported that they felt prepared for the possibility of having to manage the aftermath of a patient suicide. CONCLUSION: The chief residents identified a need for programs to focus even more attention on teaching of the care of suicidal patients in training programs.","Melton, Bengi B     Coverdale, John H     Journal Article     United States     Acad Psychiatry. 2009 Jan-Feb;33(1):47-50. doi: 10.1176/appi.ap.33.1.47.

2010-99190-115,Development and validation of a measurement scale to analyze the environment for evidence-based medicine learning and practice by medical residents,2010,1,1,,,71,,1198-1198,"Mi, Fangqiong",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=psyh&AN=2010-99190-115&site=ehost-live&scope=site,,ProQuest Information & Learning, US DB  - psyh DP  - EBSCOhost,"A growing number of residency programs are instituting curricula to include the component of evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles and process. However, these curricula may not be able to achieve the optimal learning outcomes, perhaps because various contextual factors are often overlooked when EBM training is being designed, developed, and implemented. A successful EBM training intervention must hinge on contextual analysis of these factors that may interact to form the conditions that can facilitate or hinder medical residents learning process and learning transfer. An extensive review of literature reveals little attention to any instrument used to analyze contextual factors in designing and implementing EBM training for medical residents. The purpose of the study was to develop and validate an instrument, the EBM Environment Scale, to analyze the environment for EBM learning and practice as perceived by medical residents. The development of the EBM Environment Scale underwent the process of content domain identification, item generation, review by content experts and a focus group of chief residents. All items on the scale measured responses on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Low scores on the scale represented unfavorable perceptions and high scores represented favorable perceptions of the EBM environment for residents. An EBM Environment Survey that contained the EBM Environment Scale and several demographic questions was administered to residents recruited from six programs at six training sites (four programs in internal medicine, one in family medicine, and one in pediatrics). The psychometric properties of the scale were tested with Cronbach's coefficient alpha and split-half reliability. Validity was assessed by comparing predetermined subscales with the scale's internal structure assessed via factor analysis. The scale was further validated with the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests to evaluate any differences on perception scores among groups of participants identified by gender, country of the medical school attended, level of residency training, affiliated residency program, level of prior EBM training in medical school, and level of prior EBM training during residency. One hundred twenty four out of 262 eligible residents completed the survey (a response rate of 47%). The overall mean score from the sample was 3.89 with a SD of .56. The initial reliability analysis of the 48 item scale had a high reliability coefficient (Cronbach ? = .94). Factor analysis and further item analysis resulted in a shorter 36-item scale with a satisfactory reliability coefficient (Cronbach ? =.86). The reliability coefficients for the subscales range from .62 to .98. Factor analysis verified the pre-identified structure of six factors, which accounted for 63.57% of the variance. These factors reflected different attributes or aspects that contributed to the EBM environment, including situational cues, learner role, utility and accountability, learning culture, resource availability, learning support, and social support. Perception scores differed significantly (p<.05) by residency program affiliation with mean scores ranging from 3.51 to 4.13 and by prior EBM training level in medical school with means scores ranging from 3.62 to 4.14 and during residency with mean scores ranging from 3.69 to 4.25. In initial psychometric testing, the EBM Environment Scale exhibited evidence of adequate internal consistency and construct validity. If further testing confirms its properties, it has potential to be used to understand the influence of the learning environment on the effectiveness of EBM training for residents and to evaluate the quality of the training along with other objective measures to monitor any change in learning outcomes resulted from an EBM training intervention.

In the surgery clerkship, students spend the majority of their time with residents, but often times residents are busy with other responsibilities besides teaching. We have recently adopted a structured bedside teaching curriculum that allows students to teach one another on a general surgery clerkship. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of implementing a structured curriculum in improving student performance on a surgical rotation. Methods: On daily bedside teaching rounds, common surgical topics were randomized and presented by medical students and a single chief resident to the surgical team. These presentations would typically last 5 minutes each. Pre-clerkship and post-clerkship surgical knowledge of medical students were assessed by the use of questions adapted from a general surgery textbook on topics taught on bedside rounds. The mean scores were analysed using a paired student t-test for continuous data. Results: A total of 14 third-year medical students participated in the study. A significant improvement was noted on the mean score on the post-clerkship examinations when compared to the pretest scores (72.1 vs 50.5; p<0.0001). Conclusions: This study confirms that a structured bedside teaching curriculum is an effective method for improving the performance of medical students during their general surgery clerkship. This is an effective strategy for medical schools nationwide to employ into their clerkship curriculum.","L70973255     2013-01-25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The results of preliminary analysis revealed that a relationship existed between the level of physician training and the presence of endometritis (p less than 0.01). Endometritis rates for patients under the care of attending physicians, chief residents and residents serving as the primary surgeon were six, 13 and 24 per cent, respectively. Stepwise discriminant function analysis allowed us to account for the contribution of independent risk factors for endometritis. When surgeon experience was evaluated with other risk factors, the presence of a resident serving as the lead surgeon and the age of the patient were the only significant predictors of endometritis (p = 0.046 and 0.007, respectively). The clinical and biologic relevance of the actual age difference between infected and noninfected patients (22 years for infected patients versus 25 years for noninfected patients) is not readily apparent. However, in this study, the identification of a resident acting as a lead surgeon has been shown to be a new independent risk factor for predicting endometritis. This study demonstrates the need for the evaluation of training programs for residents who serve as the principal surgeon for patients who underwent cesarean section.","Miller, P J     Searcy, M A     Kaiser, D L     Wenzel, R P     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Surg Gynecol Obstet. 1987 Dec;165(6):535-9.

This study aimed to compare the methods by which the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Educa- tion's (ACGME) HPB requirements are met in general surgery residency. Secondary objectives included determining who performs HPB surgery and which aspects of diagnostic techniques are employed to enhance HPB education. Method: A thirty-question survey was sent out to 241 general surgery program directors (PDs) via email. Analysis of the responses was completed. Results: Academic and mixed programs made up a majority of the responders. Fifty percent of these programs did not have any HPB-fellowship-trained surgeons, resulting in HPB cases being performed by general surgeons (30%) or surgical oncologists (35%). Regarding residency training, 83% of HPB cases were performed by teaching faculty at the institution; only 5% of programs sent residents to tertiary centers to achieve their required ACGME numbers. Most chief residents were completing 50-75% of each HPB case, but only 50% of PDs felt that graduating residents were competent to perform HPB surgery after graduation. Most PDs (59%) stated that none of their chief residents were entering into an HPB fellowship. More PDs believed that single most important diagnostic ability for HPB practice is intraoperative ultrasound interpretation (60%) rather than upper endoscopy (40%). Training for these diagnostic skills was performed by general surgeons (79% of programs), with endoscopy simulation available in 74%. Clinical research was more common (58%), with only 30% of programs having basic science labs. Conclusions: General surgery residency is changing, with more specialization and less autonomy for residents. More investments into simulation and training should be initiated in order to improve skill sets and expand diagnostic abilities. Enhancing residents' abilities in HPB is key to meeting the ACGME requirements for training and to graduate competent general surgeons.","L71382477     2014-03-26 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

All programs that responded (89%) reported having a journal club, with most stating its purpose was to disseminate information from the current literature. Review of classic articles and specialty topics (e.g., electromyography, sports medicine) was fairly uncommon. Eighty-four percent of journal clubs were department-sponsored, and most met monthly for 1 hr during the workday. Typically, four or more articles were presented under the guidance of the chief or other resident. Impacting clinical practice and teaching critical analysis were other important goals of the journal clubs, yet most (76%) lacked an organized method for critical review. This, in addition to poor faculty attendance, was a chief concern of those surveyed. Surprisingly, journal club participation was not felt to significantly alter the amount of reading residents did. Although most felt their journal clubs were successful, improving faculty participation, strengthening critical analysis skills, identifying and incorporating classic articles, improving clinical relevance, and providing a mechanism for feedback may further improve journal club efficacy and participant satisfaction.","Moberg-Wolff, E A     Kosasih, J B     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 1995 May-Jun;74(3):224-9.

Knowledge previously acquired by experience must now be actively taught to avoid prolonging the training period. We report the feasibility of and clinical clerk opinions regarding a novel simulated floor management course to teach patient care concepts required on the surgical wards. METHODS: We created a hospital ward with simulators exhibiting physical exam findings and active vital signs. Surgical clerks gathered data during ""morning rounds,"" wrote notes, and provided care. An acute event allowed students to participate in active evaluation and treatment. Findings and plans were communicated to their ""chief resident,"" a surgical attending. We distributed a survey to participants to determine attitudes and opinions about the course. RESULTS: The course required five faculty, two medical educators, four surgical house staff, and 2.5 h to accommodate 40-50 students. Faculty and surgical house staff provided guidance and feedback on clinical skills. Fifty students completed the survey (56% response rate). Most clinical clerks thought that the simulated floor management course improved their understanding of medical management of surgical issues (66%) and their documentation skills (78%). Clinical clerks reported that attending involvement made the experience more valuable (89%) and was not intimidating (66%). Most expressed an interest in participating in more clinical scenarios (72%). CONCLUSIONS: A simulation course for teaching patient care concepts is feasible and regarded positively by clinical clerk participants. Further development and use of such simulated patient care exercises may be an effective adjunct for training future house staff and hospital staff in patient care in a time of shifting work hour paradigms.","1095-8673     Mollo, Elizabeth A     Reinke, Caroline E     Nelson, Caroline     Holena, Daniel N     Kann, Brian     Williams, Noel     Bleier, Joshua     Kelz, Rachel R     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Res. 2012 Sep;177(1):e1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2012.03.050.

T. and Bremner, W. and Holmes, K. and Farquhar, C.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that international clinical electives can be educationally and professionally beneficial to both visiting and in-country trainees, these opportunities remain challenging for American residents to participate in abroad. Additionally, even when logistically possible, they are often poorly structured. The Universities of Washington (UW) and Nairobi (UoN) have enjoyed a long-standing research collaboration, which recently expanded into the UoN Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI). Based on MEPI in Kenya, the Clinical Education Partnership Initiative (CEPI) is a new educational exchange program between UoN and UW. CEPI allows UW residents to partner with Kenyan trainees in clinical care and teaching activities at Naivasha District Hospital (NDH), one of UoN's MEPI training sites in Kenya. METHODS: UW and UoN faculty collaborated to create a curriculum and structure for the program. A Chief Resident from the UW Department of Medicine coordinated the program at NDH. From August 2012 through April 2014, 32 UW participants from 5 medical specialties spent between 4 and 12 weeks working in NDH. In addition to clinical duties, all took part in formal and informal educational activities. Before and after their rotations, UW residents completed surveys evaluating clinical competencies and cross-cultural educational and research skills. Kenyan trainees also completed surveys after working with UW residents for three months. RESULTS: UW trainees reported a significant increase in exposure to various tropical and other diseases, an increased sense of self-reliance, particularly in a resource-limited setting, and an improved understanding of how social and cultural factors can affect health. Kenyan trainees reported both an increase in clinical skills and confidence, and an appreciation for learning a different approach to patient care and professionalism. CONCLUSIONS: After participating in CEPI, both Kenyan and US trainees noted improvement in their clinical knowledge and skills and a broader understanding of what it means to be clinicians. Through structured partnerships between institutions, educational exchange that benefits both parties is possible.","1472-6920     Monroe-Wise, Aliza     Kibore, Minnie     Kiarie, James     Nduati, Ruth     Mburu, Joseph     Drake, Frederick Thurston     Bremner, William     Holmes, King     Farquhar, Carey     R24 TW008889/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     England     BMC Med Educ. 2014 Dec 30;14:1043. doi: 10.1186/s12909-014-0246-5.

S. and O'Mahoney, P. and Bagautdinov, I. and Yeo, H. and Watkins, A. C.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: As an adjunct to simulation-based teaching, laparoscopic video-based surgical coaching has been an effective tool to augment surgical education. However, the wide use of video review in open surgery has been limited primarily due to technological and logistical challenges. The aims of our study were to (1) evaluate perceptions of general surgery (GS) residents on video-assisted operative instruction and (2) conduct a pilot study using a head-mounted GoPro in conjunction with the operative performance rating system to assess feasibility of providing video review to enhance operative feedback during open procedures. DESIGN: GS residents were anonymously surveyed to evaluate their perceptions of oral and written operative feedback and use of video-based operative resources. We then conducted a pilot study of 10 GS residents to assess the utility and feasibility of using a GoPro to record resident performance of an arteriovenous fistula creation with an attending surgeon. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test. SETTING: Academic, tertiary medical center. PARTICIPANTS: GS residents and faculty. RESULTS: A total of 59 GS residents were anonymously surveyed (response rate = 65.5%). A total of 40% (n = 24) of residents reported that structured evaluations rarely or never provided meaningful feedback. When feedback was received, 55% (n = 32) residents reported that it was only rarely or sometimes in regard to their operative skills. There was no significant difference in surveyed responses among junior postgraduate year (PGY 1-2), senior (PGY 3-4), or chief residents (PGY-5). A total of 80% (n = 8) of residents found the use of GoPro video review very or extremely useful for education; they also deemed video review more useful for operative feedback than written or communicative feedback. An overwhelming majority (90%, n = 9) felt that video review would lead to improved technical skills, wanted to review the video with the attending surgeon for further feedback, and desired expansion of this tool to include additional procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been progress toward improving operative feedback, room for further improvement remains. The use of a head-mounted GoPro is a dynamic tool that provides high-quality video for operative review and has the potential to augment the training experience of GS residents. Future studies exploring a wide array of open procedures involving a greater number of trainees will be needed to further define the use of this resource.","1878-7452     Moore, Maureen D     Abelson, Jonathan S     O'Mahoney, Paul     Bagautdinov, Iskander     Yeo, Heather     Watkins, Anthony C     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2018 Mar - Apr;75(2):497-502. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.07.024.

We hypothesized that compliance in pediatrics would be poor because of the intrinsic difficulties in performing invasive procedures in small subjects. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of pediatric house staff. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pediatric house staff members were observed while performing invasive procedures. Procedure type, number of attempts required, and patient's age and diagnosis were recorded. Degree of compliance with universal precautions was judged by means of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Comparisons between the compliant and noncompliant groups were analyzed by chi2 and 2-tailed t test. RESULTS: A total of 128 procedures performed by 43 house officers, 4 advanced medical students, and 3 chief residents or fellows were observed. Sixty-nine (53.9%) of the 128 procedures were performed correctly according to universal precaution guidelines. Rate of compliance did not appear to be influenced by small patient size, as judged by the lack of association with the age of the patient (mean+/-SD, 4.8+/-5.7 years among those in whom universal precautions were properly used vs 4.9+/-5.4 years among patients in whom precaution guidelines were breached; P=.96). Moreover, the number of attempts required in compliant procedures (1.31+/-0.53) was almost identical to that in noncompliant procedures (1.28+/-0.49; P=.73). Additionally, compliance did not improve with advanced level of training. CONCLUSIONS: Failure of compliance among pediatricians has no apparent association with procedure difficulty, and compliance rates continue to be poor through the course of pediatric training. These findings underline the need for effective education concerning universal precautions throughout pediatric residency, and they suggest that such efforts will not be precluded by obstacles intrinsic to performing invasive procedures on young subjects.","Moore, S     Goodwin, H     Grossberg, R     Toltzis, P     Journal Article     United States     Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1998 Jun;152(6):554-7.

J. and Koivunen, D. G. and Ramshaw, B. J. and Eubanks, W. S. and Stephenson, H. E.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: New advances in endoscopic surgery make it imperative that future gastrointestinal surgeons obtain adequate endoscopy skills. An evaluation of the 2001-02 general surgery residency endoscopy experience at the University of Missouri revealed that chief residents were graduating with an average of 43 endoscopic cases. This met American Board of Surgery (ABS) and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirements but is inadequate preparation for carrying out advanced endoscopic surgery. Our aim was to determine if endoscopy volume could be improved by dedicating specific staff surgeon time to a gastrointestinal diagnostic center at an affiliated Veterans Administration Hospital. METHODS: During the academic years 2002-05, two general surgeons who routinely perform endoscopy staffed the gastrointestinal endoscopy center at the Harry S. Truman Hospital two days per week. A minimum of one categorical surgical resident participated during these endoscopy training days while on the Veterans Hospital surgical service. A retrospective observational review of ACGME surgery resident case logs from 2001 to 2005 was conducted to document the changes in resident endoscopy experience. The cases were compiled by postgraduate year (PGY). RESULTS: Resident endoscopy case volume increased 850% from 2001 to 2005. Graduating residents completed an average of 161 endoscopies. Endoscopic experience was attained at all levels of training: 26, 21, 34, 23, and 26 mean endoscopies/year for PGY-1 to PGY-5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Having specific endoscopy training days at a VA Hospital under the guidance of a dedicated staff surgeon is a successful method to improve surgical resident endoscopy case volume. An integrated endoscopy training curriculum results in early skills acquisition, continued proficiency throughout residency, and is an efficient way to obtain endoscopic skills. In addition, the foundation of flexible endoscopic skill and experience has allowed early integration of surgery residents into research efforts in natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery.","1432-2218     Morales, Mario P     Mancini, Gregory J     Miedema, Brent W     Rangnekar, Nitin J     Koivunen, Debra G     Ramshaw, Bruce J     Eubanks, W Stephen     Stephenson, Hugh E     Journal Article     Germany     Surg Endosc. 2008 Sep;22(9):2013-7. doi: 10.1007/s00464-008-9760-z.

METHODS: Patients with PCa who underwent RALP prior to and after implementing a dual-console system at an academic institution were reviewed from 2006-2012. All surgeries were performed by a single-faculty surgeon well after the learning curve was established. In all cases, chief residents participated in the surgery and performed progressively more portions. Demographic, intraoperative and pathologic parameters were obtained. Continence and erectile function were assessed at 6 and 12 months. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Predictors of outcomes on univariate analysis were included in multivariate logistic or linear models. RESULTS: Of 381 patients, 185 and 196 underwent single- or dual-console RALP, respectively. There was a significant decrease in mean operative time using the dual-console system (222 vs. 171 min, p < 0.0001) as well as in the incidence of intraoperative complications (8.65 vs. 1.53%, p < 0.0001) and postoperative complications (14.1 vs. 6.63%, p = 0.03.) Complications of Clavien grade >/=3a occurred more frequently with a single-console system (7 vs. 1%, p = 0.003.) Differences persisted when controlling for potential confounders by multivariate regression. Postoperative measures of continence, erectile function and the rate of biochemical recurrence were similar between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: When training resident surgeons to perform RALP, a dual-console system may improve intraoperative and perioperative outcomes. The dual-console may represent a safer, more efficient modality for robotic surgical education as compared to a single-console system.","1433-8726     Morgan, Monica S C     Shakir, Nabeel A     Garcia-Gil, Maurilio     Ozayar, Asim     Gahan, Jeffrey C     Friedlander, Justin I     Roehrborn, Claus G     Cadeddu, Jeffrey A     Clinical Study     Comparative Study     Journal Article     Germany     World J Urol. 2015 Jun;33(6):781-6. doi: 10.1007/s00345-014-1349-7.

19634310,Decision making during preoperative surgical planning,2009,1,1,Hum Factors,0018-7208 (Print) 0018-7208,51,1,67-77,"Morineau, T. and Morandi, X. and Le Moellic, N. and Diabira, S. and Riffaud, L. and Haegelen, C. and Henaux, P. L. and Jannin, P.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes decision making during preoperative surgical planning through two cognitive indicators: conflict and cognitive control. BACKGROUND: Planning is a critical stage in naturalistic decision making, and there is some evidence suggesting that this activity depends on the level of expertise and the demands of the task. The specificity of surgery resides in the necessity to cope with (potential) conflicts between the purpose of the surgical intervention and the biological laws governing the patient's body. METHOD: Six neurosurgeons (two board-certified neurosurgeons, two chief residents, and two residents) described the operative procedure envisaged on nine surgical cases of increasing surgical complexity. A detailed analysis of one surgical case described by one expert was performed. Moreover, we measured the number of conflicts and controls reported by each surgeon. RESULTS: Two experts were the only ones for which the report of conflicts increased with surgical complexity (respectively, 75% and 73% of the conflict variance predicted by complexity). The two experts significantly activated a higher proportion of knowledge-based control (respectively, 43% and 38%) than did intermediates and residents. The residents significantly activated more motor skill-based controls (respectively, 40% and 44%) than did intermediates and experts. CONCLUSION: It seems that expert surgical decision making to cope with task demands is significantly associated with conflict monitoring. Knowledge-based control to regulate conflict is mainly produced by experts. APPLICATION: Conflicts and controls analyzed through verbal reports can be used as relevant indicators to highlight critical moments in decision making that potentially require assistance from information systems.","Morineau, Thierry     Morandi, Xavier     Le Moellic, Nadege     Diabira, Sylma     Riffaud, Laurent     Haegelen, Claire     Henaux, Pierre-Louis     Jannin, Pierre     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Hum Factors. 2009 Feb;51(1):67-77. doi: 10.1177/0018720809332847.

METHODS: A 6-week remediation program, administered jointly by Seoul National University College of Medicine's Departments of Internal Medicine (IM) and Family Medicine (FM), was initiated. The program was divided into 2 parts: 3 weeks each of IM classes that were run by specialists in various fields and FM classes that were conducted by a chief resident. Twenty-three students were required to undergo remediation after posting poor scores on 2 sessions of a CPX. On completion of the remediation program, the students' clinical performance was re-evaluated, and the changes in clinical performance scores were analyzed. RESULTS: After the remediation program, the students' total scores and scores on history taking, physical examination, physician's manner, and physician-patient interaction improved significantly. However, patient education did not improve. Most students found the remediation program to be instructive and helpful in preparation for the CPX.

Previous efforts to improve such rates have met with some success but may be costly and time-consuming. To improve events reporting rates at our academic medical center, we incorporated a physician reporting module into the computer software that house officers already use for their daily sign-out routine. METHODS: : During the period between January 1 and June 30, 2009, house staff were asked to report a set of 13 predefined ""clinically significant events"" such as cardiopulmonary arrests and unexpected transfers to the intensive care unit. Entries were maintained in an administrative data collection module and were reviewed daily by the residency program director and chief residents. RESULTS: : House staff reported approximately 12 incidents per month. A survey of the intern class (the heaviest users of system) showed that the principal barriers to physician reporting at our facility were related to ease of use, time pressure, and fear of disciplinary actions. Information gleaned from the reports has been useful in modifying a number of patient care processes on the medicine service. CONCLUSIONS: : Our experience suggests that if a training program makes it easy for the house officer to report events during routine work duties, by integrating the reporting system into the tools of daily patient care, physicians will become willing participants in the process. A handheld version of such a reporting system holds promise for even greater physician participation in the future.","1549-8425     Nabors, Christopher     Peterson, Stephen J     Aronow, Wilbert S     Sule, Sachin     Mumtaz, Arif     Jhingan, Ram     Lu, Stanlee     Cevoli, Catherine     Glickman, Linda     Fried, Ethan     Journal Article     United States     J Patient Saf. 2011 Sep;7(3):155-61. doi: 10.1097/PTS.0b013e31822d7a66.

K.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: General surgery residency training has changed with adoption of the 80-hour work week, patient expectations, and the malpractice environment, resulting in decreased resident autonomy during the chief resident year. There is considerable concern that graduating residents are not prepared for independent surgical practice. STUDY DESIGN: Two online surveys were developed, one for ""young surgeons"" (American College of Surgeons [ACS] Fellows 45 years of age and younger) and one for ""older surgeons"" (ACS Fellows older than 45 years of age). The surveys were distributed by email to 2,939 young and 9,800 older surgeons. The last question was open-ended with a request to provide comments. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of all comments was performed. RESULTS: The response rate was 9.6% (282 of 2,939) of young and 10% (978 of 9,800) of older surgeons. The majority of young surgeons (94% [58.7% strongly agree, 34.9% agree]) stated they had adequate surgical training and were prepared for transition to the surgery attending role (91% [49.6% strongly agree, 41.1% agree]). In contrast, considerably fewer older surgeons believed that there was adequate surgical training (59% [18.7% strongly agree, 40.2% agree]) or adequate preparation for transition to the surgery attending role (53% [16.93% strongly agree, 36.13% agree]). The 2 groups' responses were significantly different, chi-square test of association (3) = 15.73, p = 0.0012. Older surgeons focused considerably more on residency issues (60% vs 42%, respectively), and young surgeons focused considerably more on business and practice issues (30% vs 14%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Young and older surgeons' perceptions of general surgery residents' readiness to practice independently after completion of general surgery residency differ significantly. Future work should focus on determination of specific efforts to improve the transition to independent surgery practice for the general surgery resident.","1879-1190     Napolitano, Lena M     Savarise, Mark     Paramo, Juan C     Soot, Laurel C     Todd, S Rob     Gregory, Jay     Timmerman, Gary L     Cioffi, William G     Davis, Elisabeth     Sachdeva, Ajit K     Journal Article     United States     J Am Coll Surg. 2014 May;218(5):1063-1072.e31. doi: 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.02.001.

R. and St Claire, K.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Child abuse and neglect are leading public health problems with significant morbidity and mortality. Previous studies indicate that physicians often lack knowledge and confidence in addressing child abuse and neglect. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to assess the child abuse and neglect curricula in pediatric residency programs as reported by chief residents and to identify levels of preparedness of residents to address child abuse and neglect on graduation. We analyzed variables related to preparedness. METHODS: A 28-item survey was sent to chief residents of all 203 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited pediatric residency programs in the United States from 2004-2005. We performed descriptive, bivariable, and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: The response rate was 71%. Most programs taught didactics on physical and sexual abuse, but only 54% included domestic violence. Ninety-three percent of respondents rated their didactics as useful or very useful. Forty-one percent of programs required mandatory clinical rotations in child abuse and neglect, 57% offered elective rotations, and 25% offered no rotations at all. Respondents rated the levels of preparedness of graduating residents to address child abuse and neglect as: very well (12%), well (54%), somewhat well (28%), or not well (6%). Preparedness was significantly associated with didactic usefulness, number of hours of didactics, total number of inpatient cases of child abuse and neglect seen, percent of residents completing mandatory rotations, number of sexual abuse cases during mandatory rotation, number of physical abuse cases during mandatory rotation, and length of mandatory rotation. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory clinical experiences in child abuse and neglect improve the preparedness of graduating residents to identify and evaluate patients for child abuse and neglect. Perhaps residency training in child abuse and neglect should be a required subspecialty rotation with more explicit curricular content than in the current mandates.","1098-4275     Narayan, Aditee Pradhan     Socolar, Rebecca R S     St Claire, Karen     Journal Article     United States     Pediatrics. 2006 Jun;117(6):2215-21. doi: 10.1542/peds.2006-0160.

C. and Ebner, B. and Ford, R. D.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: One of the goals of plastic surgery residency programs is to provide effective training in aesthetic surgery. Recently, programs have adopted the idea of chief clinics to provide senior residents with the opportunity to perform cosmetic surgery with an increased level of autonomy. The goal of this article is to characterize chief clinics currently in place and their usefulness in providing effective training in plastic surgery under the precepts set forth by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. METHODS: A survey was created focusing on six broad categories: respondent identifier, clinic structure, clinic monetary earnings, patient demographics, procedures, and educational utility. Surveys were distributed to all plastic surgery residency programs targeting current and recently graduated chief residents, and program directors. RESULTS: A total of 123 surveys were returned. Eighty of the 88 plastic surgery residency programs (91 percent) were represented. Of the programs responding, 71.3 percent (57 programs) had a chief resident clinic. Thirty-two of the respondents (43.8 percent) reported that 100 percent of the procedures performed were cosmetic in nature. Programs differed widely on their frequency of occurrence and support staff available. A majority of respondents felt these clinics enhanced resident understanding of the six Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of plastic surgery training programs use the chief clinic model to enhance resident education. These clinics vary in makeup and case distribution but serve as an effective way of teaching autonomy, surgical maturity, and the six Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies.","1529-4242     Neaman, Keith C     Hill, Brian C     Ebner, Ben     Ford, Ronald D     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Plast Reconstr Surg. 2010 Aug;126(2):626-33. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181df648c.

Questionnaires were sent to the directors of all the accredited dermatology residency programmes in the United States (n = 105). A follow-up postcard questionnaire was sent to the chief resident of all the responding programmes. Eighty-three physicians responded to the questionnaire (79%). Fifty-one per cent of the respondents (n = 42) reported utilizing dermoscopy. Reported reasons for using dermoscopy by respondents included the fact that it helps detect melanoma early (74%), leads to fewer biopsies (74%) and reduces patient anxiety (64%). Lack of training (51%) and lack of usefulness (42%) were amongst the reported reasons for not utilizing dermoscopy. Sixty-seven per cent of respondents reported an increase of approximately 50% in the use of dermoscopy over the past 5 years, and 45% anticipated an increase in use over the next 5 years. Thirty-eight per cent of chief residents from the responding programmes reported receiving training in dermoscopy during residency. In conclusion, half of the dermatology residency programmes currently use dermoscopy in the evaluation of pigmented lesions. The main reason for not using dermoscopy was a lack of training.

Burnout rates among US medical students, residents and practicing physicians now exceed 50%. Though early attempts at developing individual and organizational strategies to promote physician wellness and resiliency have yielded promising results, there is still a pressing need for innovative methods to combat burnout. OBJECTIVE: To create a residency-based framework for the incentivization of productive and protective behaviors of resident wellness. We describe how we designed this framework to facilitate interactions among resident siblings as part of our program's previously established Big-Little Sibling mentorship program. DESIGN/METHODS:We devised a theme-based Wellness House Cup competition whereby residents from our pediatric and medicine/pediatric programs were sorted into 1 of the 4 Hogwarts Houses from the popular Harry Potter universe. We developed 50 wellness-related activities, giving each a wellness point (WP) value (1 to 50), proportional to their potential impact on wellness (e.g. share a meal with colleagues - 15 WPs, see your doctor - 50 WPs). Using a point-multiplier system, we incentivized big-little sibling interactions. To claim WPs, residents submitted pictures of their activities to the chief residents who tracked WP totals. Gift cards were awarded quarterly to the top WP scoring individual and house members. RESULTS: The majority of residents engaged in the Wellness House Cup as active WP scorers. After 35 days of competition, 89% of residents were active WP scorers, which increased to 98% by the 60 days. After 184 days, 100% of residents were active WP scorers. After 3 months our 56 residents had a total of 13,108 WPs (average of 234 WPs per resident). CONCLUSION: Through the creation of an innovative Wellness House Cup competition, we were able to effectively engage our entire residency within a short period of time, while promoting wellness-related activities. We hope to present resident-survey data describing measures of physician burnout. (Figure Presented) c.","L623224531     2018-07-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

A needs-assessment survey of residents at UF Medicine Residency program found 19% dissatisfaction in programmatic processes and 18% dissatisfaction in opportunities to manage fatigue and stress. In response, UF leadership created a resident-led Wellness Gator Council as a first step towards empowering housestaff to enact interventions against burnout. This study assesses the impact of grassroots interventions from the Wellness Gator Council on resident burnout. Methods: The Wellness Gator Council consisting of 10 residents and a Chief Resident met on a monthly basis. Wellness interventions included a monthly wellness event calendar, a Wellness Column in the e-newsletter, initiation of 2 sports clubs and 4 resident led morning reports. Morning reports focused on nutrition, meditation, yoga and two small group sessions that gave housestaff protected time to share their experiences with peers. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), measuring three aspects of burnout i.e. emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA), was given to residents during a noon conference in November 2016 (pre-intervention), February 2017 (mid-intervention) and August 2017 (post-intervention). Mean MBI scores of each section were compared at the three time intervals, using one-way ANOVA and Fisher's Exact test. Results: A total of 95 out of 115 residents completed the MBI. For EE, 6% scored high level of burnout; 25% scored moderate level of burnout. Mean scores were 11.92± 1.65 pre-intervention, 8.30± 1.56 mid-intervention and 13.21± 1.13 post-intervention. For DP, 38% scored high level of burnout; 36% scored moderate level of burnout. Mean scores were 10.50± 1.26 pre-intervention, 9.10± 1.53 mid-intervention, and 11.53± 1.02 post-intervention. For PA, 43% scored high level of burnout; 24% scored moderate level of burnout. Mean scores were 37.45± 1.43 pre-intervention, 37.30± 1.92 mid-intervention, and 36.92± 0.89 post-intervention. No significant difference between mean scores was seen across any time points e.g. pre-vs. post-intervention for each section (p=0.78 EE, 0.81 DP, 0.95 PA). No significant difference occurred between levels of burnout for each section (p=0.62 EE, 0.89 DP, 0.62 PA). Conclusions: Our study supports the literature citing significant burnout among residents but failed to improve MBI scores despite multiple resident-led wellness interventions. Resident-led grassroots efforts empower and engage housestaff to combat burnout. However, bottom-up efforts alone are insuffi-cient in improving burnout outcomes. Further top-down programmatic interventions are needed to create a culture of resident wellness. Our next step is to formalize a multi-modal resiliency curriculum to engage residents with varying wellness practices and differing views of wellness.","L622330577     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

K. and Chen, Y. H. and Zou, K. H. and Tuncali, K. and Silverman, S. G.",,eng,,,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine and analyze the patterns of practice of nonvascular interventional procedures in academic centers in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was administered via e-mail to the chief residents of 112 academic radiology departments in the United States. Recipients of the survey were asked to identify which sections within their respective radiology departments performed each of 43 types of nonvascular interventional procedures. An additional entry for performance of procedures by non-radiologists was provided. A total of 66 (59%) recipients responded. The statistical method used was the analysis of contingency tables. RESULTS: Percutaneous abdominal biopsies are performed mainly by abdominal and body imaging sections (43/66, 65%), followed by vascular/interventional sections (21/66, 32%). Percutaneous abdominal drainages are performed mostly by abdominal, body imaging, and computed tomography sections (40/66, 61%), followed by vascular/interventional sections. Fluoroscopically guided procedures were performed most commonly by vascular/interventional sections, including percutaneous gastrostomy (40/66, 61%), percutaneous nephrostomy (42/66, 64%), and biliary interventions such as percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (47/66, 71%). Breast and musculoskeletal procedures are performed by their respective sections most frequently. Non-radiologists perform a significant portion of certain types of procedures: paracenteses, thoracenteses, biliary interventions (particularly stone extractions), enterostomies (particularly percutaneous jejunostomies and cecostomies), and certain biopsies (kidney and prostate). CONCLUSIONS: Academic US radiology sections perform nonvascular interventional radiology procedures in a complex and nonuniform manner. The vascular/interventional sections and organ system and modality (especially CT) sections perform the bulk of the procedures included in the survey. Breast imaging sections predominate in procedures in their disciplines. A substantial number and amount of interventional radiology procedures are performed by non-radiologists.","Nikolaidis, Paul     vanSonnenberg, Eric     Haddad, Ziyad K     Chen, Yung-Hsin     Zou, Kelly H     Tuncali, Kemal     Silverman, Stuart G     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 2005 Nov;12(11):1475-82.

However, residency program directors cite numerous barriers to implementing disparities curricula, and few publications describing successful disparities curricula exist in the literature. In this report, we describe the development, implementation, and early evaluation of a longitudinal health disparities curriculum for resident physicians. We provide resource references, process, and didactic toolkits to facilitate use by other residency programs. METHODS: We used a standard, six-step model for curricular design, implementation, and evaluation. We assessed feasibility of curricular development including practicality (program cost and time requirements) and demand (resident engagement). We also assessed program and learner outcomes, including number of didactic and clinic sessions delivered and resident preparedness, attitudes, and skill in caring for vulnerable patients. RESULTS: We designed, implemented, and evaluated our curriculum in less than 1 year, with no external funding. Time costs included 100 chief resident and 20 faculty hours for curricular development, followed by 20 chief resident and 16 faculty hours for implementation. In the first year of our curriculum, 21% of residents (16 of 75) participated. We created eight didactic sessions and delivered four as intended. Residents provided 84 free clinic sessions for uninsured patients and reported increased preparedness and skill caring for vulnerable patients in 15 of 20 measured domains. Residents also reported 20 commitments to change on themes that comprehensively reflected the content of our first curricular year.

It is unknown if program directors and their respective chief residents view this position and the role of training and faculty development similarly. METHODS: Parallel surveys were sent to all family practice residency program directors and their respective chief residents to explore their perceptions of the importance of the tasks and roles of the chief resident and the effects that perceived training, feedback, and support have on the chief resident's satisfaction. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of chief residents and their program directors returned surveys that could be analyzed in parallel. Program directors placed relatively greater importance on the administrative role of chiefs. Mentioned most frequently as problems were balancing administrative duties with other tasks, dealing with personnel issues, and working with the lack of a clear job description. Chiefs who participated in formal training programs and who perceived better burnout prevention were more satisfied with their position. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of chief residents perceived gaps in the preparation for their position, particularly with regard to administrative skills. These deficiencies are particularly ironic in light of program directors' perceptions that administrative duties are of the highest importance among the tasks assigned to chief residents. Faculty development strategies and a program of burnout prevention for chief residents should be incorporated into each residency.","Norris, T     Susman, J     Gilbert, C     Journal Article     United States     Fam Med. 1996 May;28(5):343-5.

It can be used for traumatic, congenital, or developmental injuries. Medicine, with an emphasis on facial plastic surgery, has made progress in several areas, including rhinoplasty, providing good long-term results and higher patient satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cases of rhinoplasty and its subtypes in a referral center, and to understand the relevance of teaching rhinoplasty techniques in a service of otolaryngology residency. METHODS: A retrospective study that assessed 325 rhinoplasties performed by third-year medical residents under the supervision of chief residents in charge of the Service of Facial Plastic Surgery in this hospital was conducted from January of 2003 to August of 2012. The Service Protocol included the following subtypes: functional, esthetic, post-traumatic, revision, and reconstructive rhinoseptoplasty. RESULTS: Of the rhinoplasties performed 184 (56.21%) were functional, 59 (18.15%) were post-traumatic, 27 were (8.30%) esthetic, 15 were (4.61%) reconstructive, and 40 (12.30%) were revision procedures. CONCLUSION: Functional rhinoseptoplasties were the most prevalent type, which highlights the relevance of teaching surgical techniques, not only for septoplasty, but also the inclusion of rhinoplasty techniques in teaching centers.","1808-8686     Nunes, Flavio Barbosa     Crosara, Paulo Fernando Tormin Borges     Oliveira, Isamara Simas de     Evangelista, Leandro Farias     Rodrigues, Danilo Santana     Becker, Helena Maria Goncalves     Guimaraes, Roberto Eustaquio Santos     Journal Article     Brazil     Braz J Otorhinolaryngol. 2014 Nov-Dec;80(6):476-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bjorl.2014.08.002.

M.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: Operative experience during residency lays the foundation for independent practice and additional specialty training following general surgery residency. The aim of this study was to examine operative experience of general surgery residents and detail the results of an intervention aimed at improving resident record keeping in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case log system to better reflect their experience. METHODS: Residents were asked to characterize variances in recorded operative experience identified through an audit of operative logs. Based on the results of the audit, an intervention was designed to prompt timely record keeping by residents. The intervention included education and discussion of survey audit results, weekly presentation of graphs detailing operative experience, and possible missed cases in the ACGME logs and addition of a first assistant column in morbidity and mortality (M&M) logs. RESULTS: The audit of case logs identified discrepancies in 24.2% of the 636 cases examined. Chief residents were significantly more accurate (95.9%) in recording operative experience in ACGME case logs, whereas 50.3% of junior resident case logs contained variances. Residents characterized discrepancies as ""forgot to log"" (9.6%), ""staff did the case"" (5.2%), ""another resident did more of the case"" (3.6%), ""other"" (3.6%), a ""more advanced resident was present for the case"" (1.6%), ""not present for case"" (0.6%), and ""left for consult"" (0.3%). Over the 4-week intervention period, residents logged between 72.7% and 94.0% of cases. A month following the intervention period, we observed a 13.3% increase in recorded cases compared with the intervention period. Review of first assistant case logging following inclusion of a ""first assistant"" column in M&M logs demonstrated a 70.5% increase in first assistant cases logged into the ACGME system compared with the same time period a year ago. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we found that weekly displays of cases improved resident record keeping in the ACGME case log system, especially by junior residents. We believe that the addition of first assistant column on M&M lists, periodic audits reviewed at conferences, and semiannual evaluations will help junior residents more accurately report their experience during training.","1878-7452     Nygaard, Rachel M     Daly, Samuel R     Van Camp, Joan M     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2015 Nov-Dec;72(6):e178-83. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.04.022.

METHODS: The chief residents from 56 EDs were given a structured survey containing questions on the indications for TH, methods for TH induction, maintaining, and finalizing TH treatments. The participants were divided into 2 groups based on their work place (level 1 vs. level 2 centers). RESULTS: We received 36 responses to the survey. The majority of the participants (94.4%) reported that they routinely used TH. An average of 5.9 (standard deviation, 3.4) and 3.3 (standard deviation, 2.9) TH procedures were performed monthly in level 1 and 2 centers, respectively (P=0.01). The majority of level 1 and 2 centers (80.0% and 73.1%, respectively) had written TH protocols. Rectal (50.0%) and esophageal probes (38.9%) were most commonly used to monitor the patients' body temperatures. Midazolam (80.6%) and remifentanyl (47.2%) were the most commonly used sedatives. For TH induction, external cooling devices (77.8%) and cold saline infusion (66.1%) were predominant. Between level 1 and 2 centers, only the number of TH, the usage of remifentanyl, and application of external cooling device showed significant differences (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study summarizes the TH protocols used in 36 EDs. The majority of study participants performed TH using a written protocol. We observed small number of differences in TH induction and maintenance methods between level 1 and 2 centers.","Oh, Tae Gwan     Cha, Won Chul     Jo, Ik Joon     Kang, Mun Ju     Lee, Dong Woo     Journal Article     Korea (South)     Clin Exp Emerg Med. 2015 Dec 28;2(4):210-216. doi: 10.15441/ceem.15.018. eCollection 2015 Dec.

Our objective was to enhance the learner-centered format of OMR by identifying multiple resident cases organized around a central theme for each session. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: OMR is a 45-minute conference that is attended by 25 residents (PGY2/PGY3) on ambulatory rotations. The conference is led by a chief resident and attended by a faculty preceptor. DESCRIPTION: The assigned resident chooses a case and notifies the chief resident of the topic. The chief resident performs an EHR search to identify similar cases from the clinics of residents who are attending the conference. Our EHR (Epic Systems) generates reports, with search criteria including demographics, diagnoses, medications, tests ordered, vital signs and lab values. Cases are printed and the relevant content is highlighted. During OMR, the assigned resident has 20 min to present their case(s) and lead a group discussion. Next, the chief resident distributes the surprise cases to individual residents, who are asked to present the highlighted portions of their cases to the group. The chief resident leads a nonjudgmental discussion of learning points from each case, provides an overview of relevant articles/resources, and allows for commentary by the faculty preceptor. Example: The assigned resident presented three patients for whom advance directives could have been (but were not) discussed in clinic: a 34 year-old with relapsed AML, a 76 year-old with dementia, and a healthy 57 year-old. The resident reviewed relevant articles from AFP and JAGS. Next, the chief resident led a discussion of surprise cases comprising several patients in which DNR status was documented in clinic but not acknowledged upon subsequent hospital admission. The group focused on potential QI projects to improve code status visibility in the EHR. EVALUATION: Conference topics are tracked in a spreadsheet to avoid duplication. High-yield topics are identified and repeated across groups of residents. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: We have applied adult learning theory by using our EHR to identify cases for OMR. We emphasize the relevance of GIM topics by drawing cases from resident clinics; we identify knowledge gaps during the process of chart review; and we direct teaching to the needs of the learners. By splitting conference time between the resident and chief resident, we maintain audience interest and balance topic selection. We are also able to include innovative topics (e.g. cost conscious care or systems-based care) in our curriculum. An unanticipated benefit of the format is near-100 % conference attendance, as residents do not know if one of their patients is chosen as a surprise case. The primary challenge is preparation time, which used to search for surprise cases (1-2 h) and prepare content (1-2 h). The amount of time has been lessened by asking residents to pick topics within the area of expertise of the guest faculty; this improves faculty engagement and reduces the amount of time for the chief resident to prepare content. A second limitation is that topics must be drawn in the resident practice and our EHR search for certain topics (e.g. refugee health) have yielded insufficient cases for a conference.","L71496003     2014-06-17 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

K. and Ray, A. and Palamara, K.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622331311,English,,,"Needs and Objectives: Describe 3 domains in which residents can be engaged to deliver an ambulatory curriculum. Compare and contrast innovative teaching methods to engage millennial learners. Identify tools for leveraging information technology to gather timely and actionable feedback for ambulatory didactics. Setting and Participants: Early and Mid-Career Clinician-Educators Chief Residents Description: Massachusetts General Hospital's IM Residency underwent an ambulatory curricular restructuring process in 2016-17 to better meet the needs of millennial learners. Frameworks for crafting didactics sensitive to the needs of millennials rely heavily of learner preference, 1 with few longitudinal or quantitative data guiding curriculum development. We review the unique features-6 theme-based, bilevel learning blocks; collaborative didactic formats; the utilization of low-barrier IT to gather feedback-and challenges in the roll-out of the new MGH Ambulatory Curriculum. We discuss how using the GROW model of change implementation and incorporating early feedback on resident engagement and impact on practice allowed us to turn these challenges into opportunities in the new curriculum. 1.Hunt and Tucciarone. The Challenges and Opportunities of Teaching Generation Y. JGME, December 2011. Evaluation: The intervention population included 178 IM and Med-Peds residents rotating during three ambulatory learning blocks during AY 2017-18. Quantitative data was gathered from a web-based polling service at the end of each session. At the end of each theme, summative mixed-methods surveys were administered. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: The restructured MGH Ambulatory Curriculum offers insights into how peer-developed and-delivered content can be integrated into ambulatory learning blocks, and points to low-barrier technological solutions to gathering timely and actionable qualitative feedback from millennial learners. Residents identified three domains in which they can be empowered to contribute to the curriculum: Content creation: Resident-delivered Brief Educational Approaches to a Specific Topic (BEAST) talks have consistently been the highest rated sessions. Collaborative learning: Case-based discussion was embraced as the most frequently used educational format. Residents found near-peers as the most effective facilitators. Peer Coaching: Early feedback suggests peer coaching could represent a unique vehicle for improving panel management and resident leadership in the ambulatory setting. Lessons learned in using low-barrier IT to improve resident feedback have implications for program leadership. A time-sensitive Uber-style 5-star rating system (PollEverywhere) worked best as a trigger to obtain more in-depth feedback on poorly-rated sessions. iPad-delivered end-of-block summative surveys improved response rates but open-ended responses were less detailed and actionable, likely due to time constraints.

Data are obtained to improve the training of diagnostic radiology residents and to increase the understanding of radiologists and their associates about issues of interest to radiologists in training. METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to 133 accredited programs in the United States and Canada. A wide variety of demographic and common interest questions were asked. The analysis took into account geographic location of the responders and the size of the residency program. Comparisons were made to the data from prior years. RESULTS: Completed surveys from 93 programs (70%) were returned. The percentage of women residents is increasing. Important regional and size variations exist in several areas including salary, workload, prior clinical training, resident/fellow ratios, post residency plans, and call schedules. Although many chief residents feel knowledgeable about the health care system, opinions about the future of radiology and medical care are tentative.

We sought to determine the operative work of a general surgery resident by estimating what the average general surgery resident could collect if permitted to bill as a first assistant. METHODS: We used Accreditation Coucil for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) national case log reports for surgery residents graduating in 2015 to 2016. Procedures were included in the analysis if the national resident average was greater or equal to 1, and the procedure allowed billing an assistant fee. CPT codes were assigned to each Residency Review Committee procedure using the ACGME tracked codes report. A national payment amount was assigned to each CPT code using the Centers for Medicare and Mediaid Services (CMS) physician fee schedule. The standard billing rate of 16% for first assistants was used. RESULTS: The average surgery resident graduating in the 2015 to 2016 could bill for 723.8 procedures. This would generate $128, 369.80 in first assistant fees over a 5-year surgery residency. Chief residents could bill for 173.3 procedures on average, generating $31, 703.18. CONCLUSIONS: As our overall health care system shifts to incen-tivize value, graduate medical education will need to account for its costs and benefits. Accounting for the operative work of a surgery resident is one part of calculating the value of surgery residents to our health care system.","L619285488     2017-11-21 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

C. and Siemens, D. R.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: We explore the attitudes and experience of urology residents toward acute and chronic pain management during their training. METHOD: A convenience sample of Canadian Urology chief residents were invited to complete an anonymous questionnaire involving both open and closed-ended questions using a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive and quantitative statistics were used to analyze the attitudes toward pain management, including their experience and training issues. RESULTS: The response rate was 97%. Most residents agreed or strongly agreed that more formal training in acute pain (77% agreement, mean 4.03 +/- 0.98 SD) and chronic pain (68%, 3.97 +/- 0.95) management would be valuable in urology residency with only 1 respondent disagreeing that training should be mandatory. There was a significant difference of training experience in chronic versus acute pain management, with only 13% agreement (2.99 +/- 0.67) that their training in chronic pain was adequate. Most residents agreed (74%, 3.84 +/- 1.00) that most of their training in pain management came from their senior residents or fellows. Many of the residents (65%, 3.61 +/- 0.84) felt that they could manage their patients' acute pain issues independently, even in the absence of an acute pain service, although apparent knowledge of opioids was poor. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey suggest that urology residents attain their knowledge of pain management experientially with what may be insufficient formal training, particularly in chronic pain. These observations are limited by the relatively small number of respondents and by the nature of a cross-sectional, self-reported survey; however, they would appear to underscore a need to redouble efforts in residency education.","Pace, Jonathan     Jaeger, Melanie     Nickel, J Curtis     Siemens, D Robert     Journal Article     Canada     Can Urol Assoc J. 2013 Nov-Dec;7(11-12):456-61. doi: 10.5489/cuaj.1562.

To determine whether fellowships are meeting a strategic need in training, we conducted a survey to assess the current status and trends of change in MIS/GIS fellowships. METHODS: A survey was distributed to fellows currently in MIS/GIS programs in the United States and Canada in 2003 and 2006. Fellows were asked to describe demographics as well as their experience both during fellowship and residency. We compared this with aggregate data of resident experience through the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case logs, data tracked by industry, and program data from the Fellowship Council (FC) web site. RESULTS: There were 54 responses to the 75 surveys distributed in 2006 (72% response rate). MIS fellows performed more laparoscopic cases during their residency than the average graduating chief resident, but did not feel competent to perform advanced laparoscopic surgery. However, combining fellowship numbers with residency numbers does suggest that the total experience provides competency in a wide variety of procedures.

Since otolaryngology residents do not typically perform microvascular anastomosis, it is unknown if they achieve similar results. The objective of this study is to determine the success rate and complication rate during free flap reconstruction when microvascular anastomosis is performed in part by otolaryngology chief residents. STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective review. SETTING: Academic, tertiary-care referral centers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent microvascular reconstruction by the Department of Otolaryngology from 2004 through 2011. All patients had >50% of the arterial and venous anastomoses performed by the chief resident. RESULTS: The study included 93 consecutive free flaps in 88 patients: 43 radial forearm, 14 anterolateral thigh, and 36 fibula. There were 71 males and 22 females with mean age of 53. The pre-operative diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma in 78%, with 27% of patients having previously received radiotherapy and 13% of patients having had previous neck surgery. There were no instances when resident-placed sutures required revision, nor was there a perceived need to revise such an anastomosis intraoperatively. Overall flap success rate was 97%. The anastomotic complication rate was 4.3%, with venous thrombosis in three cases and arterial hemorrhage in one case. CONCLUSION: Overall free flap success rate and anastomosis-related complications with residents performing portions of the microvascular anastomosis are comparable to published studies. Otolaryngology chief residents can safely participate in microsuturing, which is a single facet in the broader skill set of a microvascular surgeon.","1532-818x     Patel, Urjeet A     Lin, Alice C     Comparative Study     Journal Article     Multicenter Study     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Am J Otolaryngol. 2013 Sep-Oct;34(5):407-10. doi: 10.1016/j.amjoto.2013.02.005.

We tried to evaluate whether LA is a risk factor for patients when it is done by novice surgeons during the different steps of their training. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of all the patients who underwent LA in our department between 2000 and 2008 was conducted. The patients were operated on by novice surgeons, chief residents, and senior surgeons. Preoperative variables were compared, as well as surgical outcomes and complications. RESULTS: During the study period, 477 LA, were performed on 320 women and 157 men, with a mean age of 39 years. In 11 cases (2.3%), the operation was converted. No difference was found in preoperative patient status. There was no difference between groups in the rate of accurate preoperation diagnosis, in comparison with the pathologic report. The rates of conversion, postoperative complications, and negative appendectomies were similar between residents and seniors. These findings were also found in a subgroup analysis, in which we compared each group. CONCLUSIONS: There is no additional risk in a LA done by a resident, whether a chief or a novice. LA is a good model for training young surgeons in laparoscopic surgery: It enables the young surgeon to engage and lead a real case and does not imbue any risk upon the patient.","1557-9034     Perry, Zvi H     Netz, Uri     Mizrahi, Solly     Lantsberg, Leonid     Kirshtein, Boris     Journal Article     United States     J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A. 2010 Jun;20(5):447-50. doi: 10.1089/lap.2009.0430.

M. and Gerstle, R. and Bhalla, S. and Menias, C. O. and Jost, R. G.",,eng,,,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Every year, the American Association of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology (A3CR2) conducts a survey of the chief residents in accredited radiology programs in the United States and Canada. The purpose of the survey is to evaluate current residents' opinions regarding a number of different issues pertaining to their educational experience, work responsibilities, and benefits. This information is useful in monitoring patterns of change in resident attitudes toward their experiences within their residency training programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online surveys were made available to the chief residents from 193 training programs in North America. For the most part, the questions were presented in a multiple-choice format, with additional space for elaboration or comments provided for many of the items. Some questions are repeated annually, addressing general topics such as salary and hospital size. However, new questions are incorporated each year. In particular, this year's survey included questions pertaining to Armed Forces Institute of Pathology course funding, and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) /basic life support certification and changes in duty work hour and call requirements in the face of changing ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) regulations. RESULTS: The results of the survey were then tabulated, and responses to several of the repeated questions were compared with those from prior surveys dating back to 1996. This year's response rate was 55%, with 106 unique responses received. This represents an improvement since last year's survey, when the response rate was 41%. In some cases, more than one response was generated by a given residency program, in which case the questionnaire that was more thoroughly completed was used for statistical analysis. Responses were received from chief residents in 37 states and in Canada. The largest number of respondents was from New York, and 80% percent of respondents were from programs affiliated with a university. Forty-two percent were incoming chief residents with less than 3 months' experience, whereas 58% were outgoing chief residents with less than 9 months remaining in their tenure. CONCLUSION: The majority of respondents report that changes made by their respective programs as the result of new ACGME maximum duty hour standards have been viewed favorably by radiology residents. Many training programs have moved toward a night float based call system in order to maintain compliance. Nearly all programs have overnight in-house radiology resident coverage, but there has been a slight decline in the percentage of programs that provide in-house attending coverage at night. The majority of residents, however, have access to attendings after-hours by pager. Finally, resident salaries and benefits continue to increase, as has been the trend over the past several years.","Peterson, Christine M     Gerstle, Ronald     Bhalla, Sanjeev     Menias, Christine O     Jost, R Gilbert     Journal Article     United States     Acad Radiol. 2005 Mar;12(3):373-8. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2004.12.014.

12455251,The accelerated residency program: the Marshall University family practice 9-year experience,2002,1,1,Fam Med,1938-3800,34,9,669-72,"Petrany, S. M. and Crespo, R.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: In 1989, the American Board of Family Practice (ABFP) approved the first of 12 accelerated residency programs in family practice. These experimental programs provide a 1-year experience for select medical students that combines the requirements of the fourth year of medical school with those of the first year of residency, reducing the total training time by 1 year. This paper reports on the achievements and limitations of the Marshall University accelerated residency program over a 9-year period that began in 1992. METHODS: Several parameters have been monitored since the inception of the accelerated program and provide the basis for comparison of accelerated and traditional residents. These include initial resident characteristics, performance outcomes, and practice choices. RESULTS: A total of 16 students were accepted into the accelerated track from 1992 through 1998. During the same time period, 44 residents entered the traditional residency program. Accelerated resident tended to be older and had more career experience than their traditional counterparts. As a group, the accelerated residents scored an average of 30 points higher on the final in-training exams provided by the ABFP. All residents in both groups remained at Marshall to complete the full residency training experience, and all those who have taken the ABFP certifying exam have passed. Accelerated residents were more likely to practice in West Virginia, consistent with one of the initial goals for the program. In addition, accelerated residents were more likely to be elected chief resident and choose an academic career than those in the traditional group. Both groups opted for small town or rural practice equally. CONCLUSIONS: The Marshall University family practice 9-year experience with the accelerated residency track demonstrates that for carefully selected candidates, the program can provide an overall shortened path to board certification and attract students who excel academically and have high leadership potential. Reports from other accelerated programs are needed to fully assess the outcomes of this experiment in postgraduate medical education.","Petrany, Stephen M     Crespo, Richard     Journal Article     United States     Fam Med. 2002 Oct;34(9):669-72.

E.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Many departments have multiple chief residents. How these coleaders relate to each other could affect their performance, the residency program, and the department. OBJECTIVE: This article reports on how co-chiefs work together during the chief year, and what may allow them to be more effective coleaders. METHODS: A phenomenological research design was used to investigate experiences of outgoing chief residents from 13 specialties at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics over a 2-year period from 2012 through 2013. Thematic analysis of semistructured interviews was conducted to investigate commonalities and recommendations. RESULTS: Face-to-face interviews with 19 chief residents from 13 different specialties identified experiences that helped co-chiefs work effectively with each other in orienting new co-chiefs, setting goals and expectations, making decisions, managing interpersonal conflict, leadership styles, communicating, working with program directors, and providing evaluations and feedback. Although the interviewed chief residents received guidance on how to be an effective chief resident, none had been given advice on how to effectively work with a co-chief, and 26% (5 of 19) of the respondents reported having an ineffective working relationship with their co-chief. CONCLUSIONS: Chief residents often colead in carrying out their multiple functions. To successfully function in a multichief environment, chief residents may benefit from a formal co-orientation in which they discuss goals and expectations, agree on a decision-making process, understand each other's leadership style, and receive feedback on their efficacy as leaders.","Pettit, Jeffrey E     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2015 Jun;7(2):203-7. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00298.1.

K. and Hurley-Martonik, D. and Kukora, J. S.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the use of physician extenders (PEs) in general surgery residency programs. STUDY DESIGN: We surveyed the program directors in surgery for the number of chief residents, PEs on general surgery services, PE duties, whether PEs were hired in response to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education work-hour restrictions, plans to hire additional PEs, and program type. Data were analyzed using the Student's t-test; p values are two-tailed and considered significant if <0.05. RESULTS: There were 163 programs (65%) that responded, (87 university, 70 nonuniversity, and 6 military programs), with a total of 689 graduating chief residents per year. One hundred sixty programs use 840 PEs (median, 3.5 PEs per program; mean, 5.3 PEs per program, 2 PEs per chief resident). One hundred twenty-seven programs (79%) use at least 1 PE (range 1 to 50 PEs); 93 programs (57%) hired 513 (61%) PEs in response to work-hour restrictions. Before 2003, the mean number of PEs per program was 2.0; after 2003, there were 5.3 per program (p=0.0001). Most common uses of PEs included taking histories and physicals (84%), seeing consults (58%), first-assisting (52%), and seeing patients in the emergency department (47%). Forty-seven of 162 (29%) programs plan to hire more PEs in the next 3 years, 76 programs (47%) would like to, but are unsure of funding; 23 programs (14%) are not planning to increase the total, and 16 programs (10%) are unsure. With available funding, 431 additional PEs may be hired in the next 3 years, for a total of 1,271 PEs in 163 programs, or an average of 7.8 PEs per program and 1.8 PEs per chief resident. CONCLUSIONS: PEs have been hired in large numbers to assist on general surgery teaching services, with most hired in response to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education work-hour restrictions, and most of their duties are intended to aid resident education. Almost 80% of programs currently use PEs; 76% would like to hire more.

S. and Malhotra, N. R.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial heralded a paradigm shift in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. During this same time frame, neurosurgical training programs increased in size and scope. The present study examines the impact of trends in surgical clipping and the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms, over one decade, and the neurosurgical resident complement on the resident teaching environment using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). METHODS: The NIS was used to estimate the number of aneurysms treated with either surgical clipping and endovascular methods from 2002 through 2011 at teaching institutions. Teaching opportunities per year per resident or chief resident were calculated as the ratio of the number of specified cases to the average number of neurosurgical trainees by year. Annualized trends were assessed. RESULTS: Over the study period, the percent change in odds of occurrence of a clipped ruptured aneurysm was -15.6% per year (P < 0.001) and of ruptured aneurysms undergoing endovascular treatment was 18.7% per year (P < 0.001) within teaching institutions. This corresponded to a decline in teaching opportunities for clipped ruptured aneurysms for both residents and chief residents (P < 0.001). In contrast, teaching opportunities for endovascular treatment of both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms increased dramatically over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant decrease in opportunity for operative exposure to craniotomy for ruptured aneurysm clipping over the past decade, whereas the volume of endovascular procedures for aneurysms has dramatically increased, highlighting the need for a shift in training strategy for those neurosurgeons graduating from residency desiring to subspecialize in neurovascular neurosurgery.","1878-8769     Piazza, Matthew     Nayak, Nikhil     Ali, Zarina     Heuer, Gregory     Sanborn, Matthew     Stein, Sherman     Schuster, James     Grady, M Sean     Malhotra, Neil R     Journal Article     United States     World Neurosurg. 2017 Jul;103:194-200. doi: 10.1016/j.wneu.2017.03.124.

Daily practice of surgery and the reading of English-language articles were the two most frequently used teaching resources. Surgical training was judged satisfactory by 41.2% of respondents. In multivariate analysis, only the function of chief-resident (p < 0.001) and authorship as first author of scientific papers (p = 0.041) were associated with a feeling of satisfaction. Surgical training on animals, use of online course materials, and the establishment of a mentoring process during residency were rated favorable by more than 80%. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of residents and chief-residents in visceral and digestive surgery in France believe their training is unsatisfactory. However, this dissatisfaction decreases progressively throughout the training period. Strengthening of companionship through tutoring, better information on existing resources, and improved access to surgical training in animals should enhance satisfaction.","1878-7886     Piessen, G     Chau, A     Mariette, C     Bouillot, J L     Veyrie, N     Journal Article     Multicenter Study     France     J Visc Surg. 2013 Nov;150(5):297-305.

The need is equally great to fortify international professional connections and support low-resource medical systems in a non-intrusive, sustainable, and culturally appropriate manner. Global Health Chief Residents (GHCRs) at the University of Minnesota (UMN) serve as clinical educators and advocates in the field of GH for all internal medicine (IM) and medicine-pediatrics (MP) residents as well as collaborators with Tanzanian providers in Arusha, Tanzania. Structure: Two GHCRs are chosen annually from the IM and MP residency classes to rotate for 6 months between the UMN IM Residency Program in Minneapolis and in 2 hospitals in Arusha. At UMN, they incorporate GH concepts into weekly residency conferences, are a resource for residents caring for international patients, coordinate and support residents on international rotations (co-teaching pre-departure orientation and tracking completion of safety requirements), and guide residents on the GH Pathway toward mentors and educational opportunities. They help to facilitate the Live GH Course and monthly Travel and Tropical Medicine Seminars. In Arusha, they orient and support visiting international residents and students. They are a resource for Tanzanian medical providers, giving lectures, teaching bedside ultrasound, rounding as consultants, and implementing quality improvement projects. Outcome & Evaluation: GHCRs have integrated GH into residency- wide morning reports and morbidity and mortality conferences. They have conducted a resident survey to gauge awareness of opportunities and baseline GH knowledge. They have supported integration of visiting medical students and residents into the Tanzanian medical system, which has decreased the burden on the local system while increasing the value of this international rotation. GHCRs have forged relationships in Tanzania, supporting the education of local medical trainees and facilitating Tanzanian provider visits to UMN. Going Forward: While the role of the GHCRs in Arusha remains flexible, the ultimate goal is to create a reliable presence for US providers traveling abroad and Tanzanian medical providers. This will decrease the burden on the Tanzanian medical system as well as strengthen consultation connections abroad, paving the way for sustainable bilateral exchange.","L614045112     2017-01-17 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>true}"

However, in many regions there is limited availability of such personnel. Purpose: We reviewed the complication rates related to PCNL access when performed at a teaching hospital to establish that access for PCNL may be safely taught to and performed by urology residents. Chief urology residents across the nation were also anonymously surveyed to understand the current trends regarding PCNL access in teaching institutions. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of all PCNL surgeries performed at our institution from 1995 to 2009 for any complications related to surgery. The complication rate was compared to those of the Society of Interventional Radiologists. A survey was also sent to all current urology chief residents regarding their experience with PCNL access during residency. Results: A total of 290 patients underwent PCNL surgery with 338 separate access sites gained at the time of surgery. Access was successfully gained in all cases at the time of surgery. Major and minor complications compared favorably to those put forth by the ACR. Our survey of residents showed a lack of widespread PCNL access instruction. Conclusions: Our results show that access for PCNL surgery can be safely and successfully obtained by GU residents under staff supervision at the time of surgery. We feel that access for PCNL surgery is a valuable tool that should be in the armamentarium of all urologic surgeons upon leaving a urology training program.","L70295456     2010-11-09 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

A. and Agarwal, A.",,eng,,,"Completing a residency program is a requirement for medical students before they can practice medicine independently. Residency programs in internal medicine must undergo a series of supervised rotations in elective, inpatient, and ambulatory units. Typically, a team of chief residents is charged to develop a yearly rotational schedule. This process is complex, as it needs to consider academic, managerial, regulatory, and legal restrictions while also facilitating the provision of patient care, ensuring a diverse educational experience, balancing the workload, and improving resident satisfaction. This study proposes (1) a multi-stage multi-objective optimization approach for generating yearlong weekly resident rotation schedules and (2) the use of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to compare schedules across multiple criteria to select those that are more equitable and hence to facilitate their adoption and implementation. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows the scheduling of periodic clinic rotation schemes that are commonly used to facilitate continuity of care, such as ""4+1"" or the ""8+2"" policies. In the ""4+1"" policy residents rotate for four consecutive weeks in different units prior to return for a week to a predetermined clinical post. Similarly, in the ""8+2"" policy, residents rotate eight weeks across multiple units before doing a two week rotation at a predetermined clinic.","Proano, Ruben A     Agarwal, Akshit     Kidd Grant/Rochester General Hospital     Journal Article     Netherlands     Health Care Manag Sci. 2017 May 12. pii: 10.1007/s10729-017-9403-9. doi: 10.1007/s10729-017-9403-9.

OBJECTIVE: This study is the first to review the 10-year experience of a resident aesthetic clinic and identifies important educational aspects necessary for residency training in aesthetic surgery. METHODS: The operative experience of each chief resident from 1994 through 2004 and the database of the resident aesthetic surgery clinic during the same period were reviewed. A questionnaire was also distributed to all past chief residents regarding their experience with the clinic. RESULTS: Over 1600 new patients were evaluated in the resident aesthetic clinic in the last 10 years, with 482 patients undergoing 805 procedures. Each chief resident performed 104.5 +/- 25.1 (mean +/- SD) procedures as a primary surgeon. The resident clinic contributed 82.4% of the total aesthetic surgery procedures, as recorded by the chief residents' Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education operative logs. For the last 10 years, the reoperative complication rate was 3.1%, and no litigation has been brought against any resident or attending surgeon.

"",Developing a standardized cps curriculum for pediatric resident trainees,2018,1,1,Paediatrics and Child Health (Canada),,23,,e50,"Purser, M. and Hunter, A. and Bhatt, M.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622972891,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Residents writing the Royal College Paediatrics exam are expected to have a working knowledge of all 223 CPS position and policy statements. However, there is limited data available regarding how best to implement a curriculum focused on resident mastery of CPS statements, and even less evidence looking at the impact of such a curriculum on resident education. OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to create a standardized resident-directed didactic teaching curriculum that enhances resident knowledge of, and exposure to, CPS position and policy statements. Furthermore, we hope to develop an innovative teaching portfolio that can be utilized by all Canadian Paediatrics training programs to enhance resident learning. DESIGN/METHODS: We have developed a novel Learn CPS Curriculum whereby paediatrics residents receive monthly formal didactic teaching sessions that are focused on reviewing high-yield CPS statements on a rotating 3-year schedule. High-yield statements were identified using a modified Delphi method incorporating expertise from senior residents and subspecialty staff. Using a 13 question Likert scale assessment, our residents were surveyed at the time of our Learn CPS Curriculum's implementation, and then again at 6 months in order to gain a better understanding of resident confidence around, and knowledge of, CPS statements. Furthermore, current Program Directors and Chief Residents in Paediatrics across Canada were also surveyed to better appreciate what (if any) similar CPS-directed curricula exist. Using this data, we hope to optimize the existing curriculum and ultimately disseminate this work for the educational benefit of all paediatric resident trainees in Canada. This project did receive HiREB approval from our institution. RESULTS: Prior to our Learn CPS Curriculum, approximately 55% (24/43) of McMaster paediatric residents felt not very confident about their CPS knowledge, yet 80% (35/43) believed knowledge of CPS statements was quite important/essential to providing optimal patient care. While >85% (38/43) of residents had read <50 statements initially, by 6 months that number had dropped to <70% (30/43). Based on results from Chief Residents and Program Directors of other Canadian Paediatrics programs that were surveyed, the majority (8/14) felt learning CPS statements is essential for residents, yet <25% (3/14) have any formal CPS curriculum. However, 100% (14/14) of respondents would consider incorporating a formal teaching curriculum based on CPS statements into their existing program. CONCLUSION: Our innovative Learn CPS initiative is one of the first formal curricula developed to help increase resident exposure to CPS statements. Preliminary results based on resident and Program Director surveys suggests that our curriculum is valued, and effective at increasing resident exposure to CPS statements. We plan on continuing to collect learner feedback to optimize our existing curriculum, & ultimately create an educational package that can be used by all Canadian Paediatrics training programs.","L622972891     2018-07-16 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

K. and Marks, M. W. and David, L. R.",,eng,,,"Cosmetic patients have many options when seeking out their surgeons. In midsize and larger cities, these options span not only different specialties but also different levels of experience. Because surgical experience can best be gained first hand, there exists a special and symbiotic relationship between a surgeon-in-training and his or her patient. Benefits stem from the opportunity for a surgeon to gain independent experience while offering cost effective benefits to patients who may or may not otherwise have access to cosmetic surgery. To meet the needs of both patients and the surgeons-in-training, the Wake Forest University Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Training Program has set up and maintained a chief resident run cosmetic surgery clinic for 17 years. Each chief resident serves as primary surgeon 1 day a week during the chief year. We present a 7-year retrospective outcome analysis of this experience. The authors performed an Institutional Review Board approved retrospective chart review of all patients who received major cosmetic procedures performed in the WFU chief resident clinic over a 7-year span from 2000 to 2007. A total of 210 charts were reviewed. Fourteen charts were excluded because of inadequate records or non esthetic procedures performed concomitantly. All procedures were viewed as independent events. A total of 196 patients underwent 272 procedures. All procedures were evaluated for major and minor complications and revisions. A total number of 272 initial cosmetic procedures were performed in a 7-year span. Adverse events were divided into major and minor complications. There were no major complications for any of the procedures. Overall minor complication rate was 8.0%. Overall revision rate was 14.4%. Procedures with greatest probability of revision were abdominoplasty and reduction mammaplasty. Chief resident clinics provide a unique experience wherein surgeons-in-training are allowed to hone previously developed surgical acumen while providing a safe and expectedly desirable result for their patients. Because many cosmetic patients desire secondary touch up procedures, a rate of 14.4% in this cohort is neither unexpected nor unacceptable. In addition, the postoperative evaluation and the decision to pursue secondary procedures provides a unique perspective to the chief residents. A chief resident run clinic can be an effective and safe learning tool, providing benefit to patient and the surgeon in training.","1536-3708     Pyle, Jeremy W     Angobaldo, Jeff O     Bryant, Allyson K     Marks, Malcolm W     David, Lisa R     Journal Article     Review     United States     Ann Plast Surg. 2010 Mar;64(3):270-4. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181afa4e9.

Confidence in initiating treatment with each of the 4 mood stabilizers was significantly associated with the number of patients treated with each mood stabilizer in the past year. Residents reported having the lowest confidence with carbamazepine followed by lamotrigine, lithium, and valproate. Experience prescribing first-line treatments for BD, such as lithium and valproate, is inadequate for many US psychiatric residents.

Yet, essential clinical skills, professionalism, and humanistic patient interactions are best taught at the bedside. PURPOSE: Clinical teaching has moved from the bedside to conference rooms; many reasons are described for this decline. This study explored perceptions of teachers and learners on the value of bedside teaching and the humanistic dimensions of bedside interactions that make it imperative to shift clinical teaching back to the bedside. METHOD: Focus group methodology was used to explore teacher and learner opinions. Four teacher groups consisted of (a) Chief Residents, (b) Residency Program Directors, (c) skilled bedside teachers, and (d) a convenience group of other Department of Medicine faculty at Boston University School of Medicine. Six learner groups consisted 2 each of 3rd-year students, PGY1 medicine residents, and PGY2 medicine residents. Each discussion lasted 60 to 90 minutes. Sessions were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative methods. RESULTS: Teachers and learners shared several opinions on bedside teaching, particularly around humanistic aspects of bedside interactions. The key themes that emerged included (a) patient involvement in discussions, (b) teachers as role models of humanism, (c) preserving learner autonomy, (d) direct observation and feedback of learners at the bedside, (e) interactions with challenging patients, and (e) admitting limitations. Within these themes, participants noted some behaviors best avoided at the bedside.

12691971,Whither bedside teaching? A focus-group study of clinical teachers,2003,1,1,Acad Med,1040-2446,78,4,384-90,"Ramani, S. and Orlander, J. D. and Strunin, L. and Barber, T. W.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: Previous reports document diminishing time spent on bedside teaching, with a shift towards conference rooms and corridors. This study explored faculty's perceptions of the barriers to and their strategies for increasing and improving bedside teaching. METHOD: Four focus groups consisting of (1) chief residents, (2) residency program directors, (3) skilled bedside teachers, and (4) a convenience group of other Department of Medicine faculty from the Boston University School of Medicine's affiliated hospitals were held in May 1998. Each session lasted 60-90 minutes. Sessions were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative methods. RESULTS: The most significant barriers reported were (1) declining bedside teaching skills; (2) the aura of bedside teaching, a belief that bedside teachers should possess an almost unattainable level of diagnostic skill that creates intense performance pressure; (3) that teaching is not valued; and (4) erosion of teaching ethic. Focus-group participants suggested the following strategies for addressing these barriers: improve bedside teaching skills through faculty training in clinical skills and teaching methods; reassure clinical faculty that they possess more than adequate bedside skills to educate trainees; establish a learning climate that allows teachers to admit their limitations; and address the undervaluing of teaching on a department level with adequate recognition and rewards for teaching efforts. Skilled teachers, in particular, stated that a bedside teaching ethic could be reestablished by emphasizing its importance and challenging learners to think clinically. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside teaching is regarded as valuable. Some barriers may be overcome by setting realistic faculty expectations, providing incentives for teaching faculty, and establishing ongoing faculty development programs.","Ramani, Subha     Orlander, Jay D     Strunin, Lee     Barber, Thomas W     Journal Article     United States     Acad Med. 2003 Apr;78(4):384-90.

Formal programs to teach these competencies are lacking. The study aims to assess the feasibility and utility of a unique surgical palliative care immersion training program. STUDY DESIGN: A half-day Surgical Palliative Care Immersion Training (SPCIT) was developed using the American College of Surgeon's manual titled ""Surgical Palliative Care: A Resident's Guide"" as a framework. The training format was modeled after the highly successful University of Arizona Center on Aging's Interprofessional Chief Resident Immersion Training (IP-CRIT) Program to teach palliative care competencies to general surgery residents. Objective and self-assessments were performed at baseline, immediately post training and 5-months after training. For all pre-test, post-test comparisons on Likert scale, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used. For aggregate scores a repeated-measures analysis of variance was used. RESULTS: Forty of the forty-eight residents (83%) completed the learner's needs assessment survey. Thirty-four (71%) of the forty-eight residents in the residency program participated in the SPCIT. Significant improvement was noted in objective assessment of post-test aggregate scores (Mean difference 2.15, 95% CI 0.52-3.77, p = 0.0083). There was a significant increase in proportion of residents who felt confident in discussing palliative care options (96.5% vs. 27.5%, p < 0.0001); end-of-life care (86.2% vs. 52.5%, p < 0.0065); code status (86% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001); prognosis (96% vs. 35%, p < 0.001); or withholding or withdrawing life support (79.2% vs. 45%, p = 0.0059) with patient/families after the SPCIT. CONCLUSION: The newly developed SPCIT program drastically improves knowledge, attitudes and perceived skills of general surgery residents. Similar training can be implemented in other surgical residency programs.","1879-1883     Raoof, Mustafa     O'Neill, Lisa     Neumayer, Leigh     Fain, Mindy     Krouse, Robert     Journal Article     United States     Am J Surg. 2017 Aug;214(2):378-383. doi: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2016.11.032.

H. and Leung, Y. Y. and Rashid, M. J. and Oleyourryk, G. and Valvo, J. R. and Eichel, L.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: Robotic-assisted surgery using the da Vinci Surgical System is gaining popularity among urologists. However, training residents to use this system presents new challenges for surgical educators. We describe a method for training residents to perform robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Residents first received da Vinci certification training followed by table-side assistance with a second attending urologist present to provide real-time instruction. After demonstrating proficiency with assistance, residents performed segments of robotic prostatectomies as the console surgeon. The procedure was divided into five steps: (a) bladder take-down, (b) endopelvic fascia and dorsal venous complex, (c) bladder neck and posterior dissection, (d) neurovascular bundles, and (e) urethral anastomosis. Performance was rated using an analog scale (0, very poor to 5, outstanding). The resident was allowed to proceed to the next step once proficiency (score greater than 3 of 5) had been demonstrated on three separate occasions. In addition, each procedure was digitally recorded and reviewed with the attending physician after the operation. RESULTS: Two chief residents underwent this training regimen. All 83 cases with surgical console involvement during a 7-month period were reviewed. The combined residents' mean operative time in minutes and overall performance (score 0 of 5 to 5 of 5) for each step were recorded. Using logistic regression analysis, a statistically significant trend was seen, with faster operative times and greater analog scores over time for both residents (P <0.005). CONCLUSIONS: A systematic approach can be used to safely and effectively train urology residents to perform robotic radical prostatectomy using the da Vinci robotic system.","1527-9995     Rashid, Hani H     Leung, Yuk-Yuen M     Rashid, Megan J     Oleyourryk, Gregory     Valvo, John R     Eichel, Louis     Journal Article     United States     Urology. 2006 Jul;68(1):75-9. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2006.01.057.

P. and Berg, D.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: To assess how the surgical skills of residents are taught and evaluated within dermatology residency programs in the United States; to assess which surgical techniques training directors and residents consider important for residents to perform or at least understand by the end of residency training. METHODS: A 126-question survey was sent to all 106 of the US dermatology residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Contact was initially made via e-mail. Surveys were addressed to the program director, surgical training director, and chief resident of each program. A follow-up survey was mailed to nonresponders. RESULTS: Ninety-five surveys were returned representing 71 (67%) of 106 programs. Eighty-nine percent of programs (n=63) reported having a formal curriculum in dermatologic surgery. Among programs represented, 97% (n=69) taught surgical skills in the procedure room, 84% (n=57) used pigs' feet, and fewer than 10% (n=6) used human cadavers. Ninety-four percent of programs (n=61) scheduled surgical lectures; two thirds (n=41) formally assigned surgical reading, and over half (n=36) used Web-based lectures to teach skills. To assess training, most programs (86%; n=50) used subjective global evaluation at the end of a surgery rotation. Fewer than 30% (n=15) discussed specific objectives prior to the rotation. Only about 25% of programs (n=17) reported the use of written or oral examinations to assess resident surgery skills. Traditional biopsy and simple surgical procedures were reported as most important to know and perform. Interest by both faculty members and residents in more advanced surgical techniques was more limited and variable. Cosmetic surgery techniques were most likely to be viewed as unimportant. CONCLUSIONS: Most dermatology programs teach surgical skills by traditional apprenticeship methods supplemented by work in pigs' feet laboratory classes and regularly scheduled lectures. Skill assessment is mainly done through subjective means. Almost all respondents thought that basic biopsy and excisional skills were essential for residents to know and perform. More complex surgical techniques and the use of lasers were considered less important. Cosmetic techniques were those most frequently viewed as unimportant.","Reichel, Jennifer L     Peirson, Ryan P     Berg, Daniel     T32 AR07019/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

Midlevel practitioners (MLPs) were employed by a large community teaching hospital to augment the surgical teaching service, to improve continuity of patient care, and to provide resident physicians with greater flexibility to participate in classroom, operative, and clinical educational experiences. The MLPs were carefully integrated into the surgical program by creating the necessary buy-in, developing positive relationships, decreasing resistance, and reinforcing acceptance when demonstrated. MLPs function at the level of junior resident physicians and are active participants in the teaching and evaluation process. Structurally, MLPs receive their assignments from and report to the chief resident physician, but are ultimately responsible to the program director. Instituting the program required providing financial justification to administration and flexibility in meeting the diverse needs of the four teams. As a result, surgical resident physicians have been sufficiently freed from service activities to be able to capitalize on learning activities that range from surgeries to conferences. MLPs can be integrated into a surgical teaching program and become a positive force in the education of resident physicians.","Reines, H David     Robinson, Linda     Duggan, Mary     O'brien, Beverly M     Aulenbach, Kristen     Journal Article     Review     United States     Am J Surg. 2006 Jul;192(1):119-24. doi: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2006.01.047.

H. and Yuan, P. and Satterfield, J.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71495985,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Patient-centered medical care remains a primary goal of all health care providers and medical centers. Institutions are under increasing pressure to improve patient-centered outcomes, including patient satisfaction, and patients are taking a more active role in their own healthcare. Although the majority of providers believe they practice patient-centered care, patients frequently do not understand their condition or care plan, and their psychosocial characteristics are not considered. One of the primary means for improving the patient-centeredness of the care we provide is through patient engagement and shared decision-making (SDM). The objective of the curriculum is to improve patient engagement and SDM using a multi-modal strategy including train-the-trainer workshops, an educational campaign and expert observations with a real time feedback and audit system. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The curriculum is being piloted in 2013-2014 over a 6 month period at two large academic medical centers with internal medicine hospitalists, pediatric hospitalists and internal medicine and pediatric chief residents and residents. DESCRIPTION: We developed a patient engagement and SDM curriculum as a multimodal strategy with three parts: 1) a series of train-the-trainer workshops for residents, chief residents and hospitalist faculty, with interactive exercises and videotaped role plays on SDM using the ASK-INFORM-ASK model; 2) an educational campaign and roll out including pocket cards, announcements, posters, reminders; and 3) expert faculty observations with real-time assessment with audit and feedback to the inpatient teams. A validated instrument, the Rochester Participatory Decision Making Scale (RPAD), is being used as a pedagogical tool and as a means to assess physician engagement in SDM. Program evaluation will include retrospective pre-post workshop questionnaires, RPAD ratings, and pre-post patient surveys. EVALUATION: To date, a total of 20 medicine residents, fellows, and hospitalists have participated in the workshops. All participants showed improved confidence in using SDM tools, with a mean increase of 0.456 on a 4-point Likert scale. Participants rated their knowledge and self-efficacy in SDM higher after participating in the curriculum in all categories. The largest impact was on participants' confidence with inviting patient and family participation in SDM (mean increase of 0.850), followed by confidence with asking about patient/family agreement with the decision and examining the patient's or family's concerns and problems with follow through (mean increase 0.800 and 0.700 respectively). Residents and hospitalist faculty agreed or strongly agreed that they learned skills applicable to future practice. There will be eight additional workshops in 2014, which will train approximately 40 residents and 40 hospitalists prior to the campaign launch and expert observations. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: This train-the-trainer curriculum, including an educational campaign and use of a validated instrument to evaluate SDM at the bedside, is a novel approach to medical education and faculty development and improves learner self-efficacy. Participants were recruited to disseminate SDM and to actively engage other trainees and faculty by role modeling best practices and teaching SDM to the inpatient teams.","L71495985     2014-06-17 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

R. and Morris, J. B.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Surgical educators are charged with ensuring that their trainees conduct themselves in a professional manner. The authors retrospectively reviewed a 10-year experience of incident reports on surgical housestaff to determine patterns and predictors of behavior. METHODS: A retrospective review of all letters, e-mails, and incident reports was conducted for general surgery residents from 1995 to 2005. Descriptive variables were selected for binary categorization (not mutually exclusive): poor professional conduct, protocol violation, administrative deficiency, verbal mistreatment, physical boundary issues, mistreatment of superiors, and deficient medical student interaction. Resident status was defined as current, graduate, and attrition. RESULTS: Of 110 residents [90 [82%] categorical, 23 [21%] undesignated preliminary (3 overlapped both groups); 87 [79%] male, 23 [21%] female] who trained at the University of Pennsylvania during this period, 66 complaints were generated about 29 individuals. Overall, 50 of the 66 complaints (76%) were directed toward men and the remaining 16 (24%) toward women; 24% of all men and 35% of all women received 1 or more complaints. A total of 76% of complaints concerned categorical residents and 24% undesignated preliminary residents. And 26% of all categorical residents and 26% of all preliminary residents received at least 1 complaint. The most common complaints concerned professional conduct (83%), protocol violation (33%), verbal mistreatment (23%), deficiencies of administrative duties (8%), violations of physical boundaries (5%), deficient medical student interaction (5%), and mistreatment of attendings by residents (3%). Recipients of verbal mistreatment included staff nurses (27%), radiology technicians (13%), medical students (13%), environmental services employees (7%), security guards (7%), patients (7%), surgery attendings (7%), anesthesia attendings (7%), internal medicine chief residents (7%), and pharmacists (7%). A total of 31% of the complaints were regarding residents who involuntarily departed and 7% regarding residents who left voluntarily before completion. The mean PGY level at first complaint was 2.2 years. Of the 29 residents receiving complaints, 16 had recurrent offenses (range 2 to 7 total complaints, positive predictive value [PPV] 53%). CONCLUSION: Resident misbehavior manifests early and recurs often. Furthermore, it is frequently directed toward perceived subordinates. Nondesignated preliminary status, premature departure from the program, and the eventual selection of specific subspecialty fellowships seems to increase the risk for resident misbehavior. Identified residents require close surveillance and remediation.","Resnick, Andrew S     Mullen, James L     Kaiser, Larry R     Morris, Jon B     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2006 Nov-Dec;63(6):418-25. doi: 10.1016/j.cursur.2006.05.004.

A steep learning curve, lack of an adequate number of cases, and a shortage of experienced staff are reasons cited as barriers to the acquisition of these skills by surgical residents. We hypothesize that advanced laparoscopy can be taught during residency without additional fellowship training. STUDY DESIGN: ast surgical residents who completed training at our rural, community-based, 140-bed hospital from 1992 to 2000 were contacted by mailed surveys and a followup telephone interview. Advanced laparoscopy was defined as cases other than cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and diagnostic laparoscopy. Five attending surgeons routinely perform advanced laparoscopy. RESULTS: The response rate to the survey was 93.3% with 15 of 18 graduates currently practicing general surgery and 100% of the surgeons performing advanced laparoscopy. Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy, splenectomy, colectomy, Nissen fundoplication, and adrenalectomy were performed by 12 (85.7%), 10 (71.4%), 11 (78.6%), 13 (92.9%), and 9 (64.3%) surgeons, respectively. Eight (57.1%) surgeons reported confidence to perform advanced laparoscopy immediately after residency. All graduating chief residents from the last 3 years expressed this confidence.

T. and Broder, M. I. and Hildreth, E. A.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: To receive feedback from chief medical residents about what they and their residents would think of proposed revisions of the Special Requirements for Residency Programs in Internal Medicine. METHOD: A 71-item questionnaire was mailed in the fall of 1991 to a chief resident at each of 426 U.S. internal medicine residencies. A five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), was used. In addition, the chief residents were asked for qualitative comments. The chief residents were requested to reflect residents' opinions when completing the questionnaire. RESULTS: 272 (64%) of the questionnaires were returned. The mean rating for all questions was 2.12, SD, 0.66. The 12 changes most strongly supported (means < or = 1-1.46) included enhanced training in interviewing, communication, and interpersonal skills and in physical examination skills; emphasis on residency as an educational experience and on general internal medicine in the design of core lectures and ambulatory care clinics; and a requirement for written parental leave policies. Areas of moderate to less strong agreement included requirements for faculty and resident research, and that residents report moonlighting experiences to their program directors. CONCLUSION: The chief residents supported most of the proposed revisions of the Special Requirements, including a new proposal for enhancing professionalism in residency. The data reinforce the need to make residency education consonant with the practice of medicine and the changing demographics of the profession as well as to address resident indebtedness.","Reynolds, P P     Stickley, W T     Broder, M I     Hildreth, E A     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

In 1984 we instituted a trauma rotation between the University of Louisville (U.L.), with a large trauma volume, and Loyola University (L.U.) in the planning stages of trauma center development. Third year L.U. residents rotated at U.L. in 3-month blocks with an increased level of responsibility monthly, culminating in major decision-making roles and operative treatment under the chief resident's direction. The L.U. residents functioned as full members of the team and not as passive observers. Fifteen L.U. residents and 12 U.L. residents rotated during this period. Yearly major trauma visits, helicopter flights, and trauma service admissions average 1,908, 700, and 1,520, respectively. U.L. chief residents averaged 136 major operative trauma cases and 115 nonoperative trauma cases each were managed during this time period (RRC records greater than 85th percentile for all U.L. residents). L.U. residents performed an average of 30 major operative cases, nine as teaching assistant, in 3 months. Each managed more than 75 nonoperative cases. Several elements are critical in such a multi-institutional rotation: 1) active communication among the program directors, 2) commitment to one sharing arrangement only, 3) financing and malpractice for off-site residents, 4) housing, and 5) the ability to assimilate off-site residents as true trauma team members. The resident-to-resident interplay is crucial and has succeeded because both residency staffs have had excellent early training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Richardson, J D     Freeark, R J     Miller, F B     Baker, W H     Polk, H C Jr     Journal Article     United States     J Trauma. 1989 Sep;29(9):1211-5; discussion 1215-6.

This study describes and evaluates an integrated family medicine residency programa 4-year program that overlaps with the final year of medical school. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed multiple data sources, including In-Training Examination scores, patient visit profiles, resident demographics, and graduate surveys. RESULTS: Integrated residents (IRs) perform significantly better than traditional residents on In-Training Examinations at each year of residency training, with the difference in mean scores decreasing over time (67.8, 39.6, and 33.0 points better in the first, second, and third residency years). No evidence of increased patient continuity or panel size was noted. A higher proportion of IRs serve as chief residents, rate their residency experience as ""excellent,"" and remain with the program through graduation. Practice characteristics immediately after residency do not significantly differ. Financial benefits are evident for the IRs as well as the hosting department.

Its purpose was to assess the qualitative and quantitative aspects of graduate education in surgery as determined by the surgical trainees themselves. The questions were divided into three main sections: (1) personal demography; (2) the nonoperative characteristics of the major general surgical experience; (3) the quality, quantity, and independence of elective and emergent surgical procedures during the final year of training. A total of 922 questionnaires were mailed and 601 (65%) were returned. Of the 601 respondents, 138 were foreign medical graduates (23%). More than 80% of respondents indicated that they were the operating surgeon in two thirds or more of elective or emergent cases. The independence of that experience was substantial. Foreign medical graduates acted as operating surgeon as often, but were supervised more closely than their American counterparts. Research availability was adequate, but participation was infrequent and correlated significantly with the numbers of attending surgeons doing research in their institution. Sixty percent of respondents indicated that included in their training program was a specifically designated chief resident service. This type of training program offered more emergent than elective surgery, had significantly less attending coverage, and was found more frequently in those institutions where there were more emergent and indigent patient populations.","L10034329     1980-10-09 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"
24381664,Are we getting through? A national survey on the CanMEDS communicator role in urology residency,2013,1,1,Can Urol Assoc J,1911-6470 (Print)     1911-6470,7,11,437-41,"Roberts, G. and Beiko, D. and Touma, N. and Siemens, D. R.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: Physician communication skills are paramount to patient satisfaction and are linked to important clinical outcomes. Although well-codified in the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) CanMEDS program, the knowledge, skills, and assessment of communication skills in surgical specialty training are rarely addressed. We assess Canadian urology residents' experience of and attitudes towards this crucial competency in training and practice. METHODS: An anonymous, cross-sectional, self-reported questionnaire was administered to all final year urology residents in Canada from 2 consecutive graduating years (2010 and 2011). A closed-ended 5-point Likert scale was used to assess familiarity with the concept of the RCPSC Communicator role and its application and importance to training and practice. Descriptive and correlative statistics were used to analyze the responses, such as the availability of formal training and resident participation in activities involving health communication. For ease of reporting, an agreement score was created for those responding with ""strongly agree"" and ""agree"" on the Likert scale. RESULTS: There was a 100% response rate from the chief residents for both of the 2 years of the survey (n = 58). When questioned about the RCPSC CanMEDS roles, only 45% could identify the correct number of roles, and only 19% could correctly list all 7 roles. However, most residents were well aware of the Communicator role (90% agreement [mean 4.47 +/- 0.78]), and most agreed that it plays an important role during training and future practice (83% [4.16 +/- 0.84], 90% [4.39 +/- 0.84] respectively). This is in stark contrast to perceived formal training. Only 31% (3.00 +/- 1.04) agreed that formal training or mentorship in communication was available at their institution, and only 38% (3.14 +/- 1.19) felt that communication had been formally addressed during explicit sessions. Despite most of the respondents agreeing they had a significant mentor/role model to emulate regarding communication skills, only 48% believed that faculty frequently addressed communication during clinical learning experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Despite knowledge and acceptance of the importance of the Communicator role, there is a perceived lack of formal and explicit training in this essential non-medical expert role of urology residency. It would seem apparent from this needs assessment that there may be an opportunity to coordinate efforts to ensure formal instruction and evaluation in our training programs.","Roberts, Gregory     Beiko, Darren     Touma, Naji     Siemens, D Robert     Journal Article     Canada     Can Urol Assoc J. 2013 Nov-Dec;7(11-12):437-41. doi: 10.5489/cuaj.264.

A.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether Medical Informatics education among house staff is included in the current residency curriculum, and to present ways in which this type of education may be improved. DESIGN: During autumn 1996 a mailed survey was distributed to chief residents of American paediatric residency programmes. Questions included the resident's use of computers, the influence of Informatics-trained faculty members on programme education and plans for curriculum expansion. SETTING: Division of General Paediatrics, University of Alabama, United States. SUBJECTS: Paediatric chief residents. RESULTS: Eighty programmes (63%) returned a survey. An average of 97% of residents use the computer for looking up patient laboratory results, while 70% use it for Medline searches. Less than half of all residents use the Internet or computer-based learning programmes. Thirty-seven per cent of programmes provided formal lectures on computer topics, and 22% of programmes provided hands-on Internet training. There was no association between the presence if Informatics faculty and current programmes; however, programmes with Informatics faculty were more likely to have future curriculum plans (P=0.04). Some of the programmes' future plans are described. CONCLUSIONS: We felt that an overall description of what is currently being done with computers would be helpful as a baseline for other programmes considering new curricula changes. Residents use the computer often to check patient laboratory results but not as much for self-education. Many programmes are expanding their Informatics curriculum. Faculty without formal Informatics training can take part in basic computer education for residents. A self-study approach by the residents has been received positively.","Roberts, J R     Spooner, S A     Journal Article     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

Despite not having really planned this early phase of her career, this author has learned some things that she believes have been helpful for her in her career and may be useful for other women seeking leadership positions in psychiatry. Although it is challenging and rewarding to try to take on leadership positions it can also be stressful and draining, especially in psychiatry as we deal with patients who are unhappy and looking to physicians to heal them. Psychiatrists often sit for many hours on end speaking to people who feel hopeless and helpless. It is, therefore, essential that clinicians find some ways to balance their lives. There is no one thing that works for every woman, but it is important that there be some time for you in the day; otherwise you will get burnt out. In summary, looking back on her career, there are some things that the author has done well and others that she has not done so well.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current practice of obtaining autopsy consent, by assessing the consent forms currently in use, the knowledge and attitudes of chief residents on the procedure, and the expert opinion of pathologists in those institutions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-seven US teaching hospitals. RESULTS: Of all autopsy consent forms we surveyed, 84.7% contained 7 of 10 elements recommended by the College of American Pathologists. Only 7.1% of institutions supplied educational materials for the physician, as recommended by the College of American Pathologists. Overall, 50.1% of chief residents reported deficiencies in their knowledge of the autopsy procedure. Correspondingly, greater than 74.5% felt that educational materials would be beneficial for physicians and the family. Finally, 93.3% of chief residents believed that a limited autopsy should be offered to families, while 68 (90%) of 76 pathologists at these institutions believed that limited autopsies are an unsatisfactory alternative to the complete procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Chief residents at US teaching hospitals reported substantial deficiencies in their knowledge about autopsy and desire more training on the consent process. Autopsy consent forms are often lacking information that might help physicians and families in making an educated choice about autopsy.

Although many teaching skills training programs for residents exist, there is a lack of reports in the literature evaluating similar programs during fellowship training. AIM: To describe the implementation and evaluation of a unique program aimed at enhancing educational knowledge and teaching skills for subspecialty medicine fellows and chief residents. SETTING: Fellows as Clinician-Educators (FACE) program is a 1-year program open to fellows (and chief residents) in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Iowa. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The course involves interactive monthly meetings held throughout the academic year and has provided training to 48 participants across 11 different subspecialty fellowships between 2004 and 2009. PROGRAM EVALUATION: FACE participants completed a 3-station Objective Structured Teaching Examination using standardized learners, which assessed participants' skills in giving feedback, outpatient precepting, and giving a mini-lecture. Based on reviews of station performance by 2 independent raters, fellows demonstrated statistically significant improvement on overall scores for 2 of the 3 cases. Participants self-assessed their knowledge and teaching skills prior to starting and after completing the program. Analyses of participants' retrospective preassessments and postassessments showed improved perceptions of competence after training. CONCLUSION: The FACE program is a well-received intervention that objectively demonstrates improvement in participants' teaching skills. It offers a model approach to meeting important training skills needs of subspecialty medicine fellows and chief residents in a resource-effective manner.","1949-8357     Rosenbaum, Marcy E     Rowat, Jane A     Ferguson, Kristi J     Spengler, Erin     Somai, Poonam     Carroll, James L     Vogelgesang, Scott A     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2011 Sep;3(3):302-8. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-10-00109.1.

D. and Nagler, J. and Lovejoy, F. H., Jr. and Hafler, J. P.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the pedagogic characteristics of a clinical conference for senior pediatric residents and selected faculty. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Nineteen senior pediatric residents and 14 selected faculty members participated in a daily clinical conference at Children's Hospital, Boston, Mass. DESIGN: Qualitative research design using videotapes of nine consecutive hour-long sessions to generate pedagogic topics to be investigated using a questionnaire administered to participating residents and faculty. Narrative responses were analyzed to find pedagogic themes. RESULTS: Analysis of videotapes generated the following three topics: What facilitated learning? What was learned? What makes the process of teaching and learning effective? In the questionnaire residents indicated that learning was facilitated by resident-faculty interactions (19/19), faculty participation (19/19), and information resources (12/19). Content learned included information (16/19), approach to diagnosis (11/19), management strategies (14/19), and different perspective (14/19). An effective process of teaching and learning was attributed to case-based resident initiated discussion (19/19), facilitation by the chief resident (16/19), and non-competitive discussions in which expert faculty played a nondominant role (19/19). Faculty identified identical factors relating to all three themes. The mean rating of the conference was 4.5/5 (SD, +/- 0.50) and 4.7/5 (SD, +/- 0.45) by residents and faculty, respectively (Likert scale, 1 to 5). CONCLUSIONS: The pedagogic effectiveness of this conference was attributed to a resident-centered, case-based learning format and a discussion process characterized by noncompetitive interactions among faculty and residents, strong group facilitation by the chief resident, and participation of faculty experts in a nondominant role.","Rosenblum, N D     Nagler, J     Lovejoy, F H Jr     Hafler, J P     Journal Article     United States     Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1995 Sep;149(9):1023-8.

C.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: The weekly Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conference, a Residency Review Committee on Surgery required conference, is a hallmark of general surgery residency training. This conference has been used traditionally to teach and assess the ACGME General Competencies of patient care and medical knowledge. The author's department has changed the format of their weekly M&M conference so that it enables them to teach and assess residents also in terms of the ACGME General Competencies of practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills, and systems-based practice. METHODS: Each Monday the chief resident on each teaching service compiles a list of patient discharges and deaths for the previous week. Although all deaths are presented, only significant patient complications are selected for the following week's M&M conference. This 2-week preparation period enables the resident, who was primarily involved in the care of the patient, to thoroughly review the case and prepare his/her presentation. At the conference, the resident presents the patient's history and discusses the complication or death, not only in terms of the patient care provided (traditional M&M model), but also it analyzes the case in terms of health-care systems problems that may have contributed to the patient's morbidity and/or mortality; patient safety issues; communication problems with the patient, family, or other health-care workers; and ethnic or ethical issues related to the care provided. The case is then reviewed by faculty surgeons. Again, not only is the patient care critiqued, but also systems problems, communication problems, and ethical dilemmas. Each resident who presents a case at the M&M conference also completes a practice-based improvement log. This form analyzes the patient's outcome including factors leading to the complication and/or mortality, opportunities for systems improvement, patient safety or communication problems, ethnic or ethical issues, what the resident would do different in his/her practice, and references consulted for this case. These forms are reviewed with the resident by the Residency Director and become part of the resident's portfolio. CONCLUSION: The restructuring of the M&M conference so that a case is analyzed with all ACGME General Competencies has made the M&M conference more interesting and has improved the educational aspects of the conference. Analyzing a case according to the various ACGME General Competencies has provided another method to teach these competencies to their residents and a tool to determine whether the residents are meeting the competencies.","Rosenfeld, Joel C     Journal Article     United States     Curr Surg. 2005 Nov-Dec;62(6):664-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cursur.2005.06.009.

12114167,A communication assessment and skill-building exercise (CASE) for first-year residents,2002,1,1,Acad Med,1040-2446,77,7,746-7,"Roth, C. S. and Watson, K. V. and Harris, I. B.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Good communication skills are essential for residents entering postgraduate education programs. However, these skills vary widely among medical school graduates. This pilot program was designed to create opportunities for (1) teaching essential interviewing and communication skills to trainees at the beginning of residency, (2) assessing resident skills and confidence with specific types of interview situations, (3) developing faculty teaching and assessment skills, (4) encouraging collegial interaction between faculty and new trainees, and (5) guiding residency curricular development. DESCRIPTION: During residency orientation, all first-year internal medicine residents (n = 26) at the University of Minnesota participated in the communication assessment and skill-building exercise (CASE). CASE consisted of four ten-minute stations in which residents demonstrated their communication skills in encounters with standardized patients (SPs) while faculty members observed for specific skills. Faculty and SPs were oriented to the educational purposes and goals of their stations, and received instructions on methods of providing feedback to residents. With each station, residents were provided one and a half minutes of direct feedback by the faculty observer and the SP. The residents were asked to deal with an angry family member, to counsel for smoking cessation, to set a patient-encounter agenda, and to deliver bad news. A resident's performance was analyzed for each station, and individual profiles were created. All residents and faculty completed evaluations of the exercise, assessing the benefits and areas for improvement. DISCUSSION: Evaluations and feedback from residents and faculty showed that most of our objectives were accomplished. Residents reported learning important skills, receiving valuable feedback, and increasing their confidence in dealing with certain types of stressful communication situations in residency. The activity was also perceived as an excellent way to meet and interact with faculty. Evaluators found the experience rewarding, an effective method for assessing and teaching clinical skills, a faculty development experience for themselves in learning about structured practical skills exercises, and a good way to meet new interns. The residency program director found individual resident performance profiles valuable for identifying learning issues and for guiding curricular development. Time constraints were the most frequently cited area for improvement. The exercise became feasible by collaborating with the medical school Office of Education-Educational Development and Research, whose mission is to collaborate with faculty across the continuum of medical education to improve the quality of instruction and evaluation. The residency program saved considerable time, effort, and expense by using portions of the medical school's existing student skills-assessment programs and by using chief residents and faculty as evaluators. We plan to use CASE next year with a wider variety of physician-patient scenarios for interns, and to expand the program to include beginning second- and third-year residents. Also, since this type of exercise creates powerful feedback and assessment opportunities for instructors and course directors, and because feedback was so favorable from evaluators, we will encourage participation in CASE as part of our faculty educational development program.","Roth, Craig S     Watson, Kathleen V     Harris, Ilene B     Journal Article     United States     Acad Med. 2002 Jul;77(7):746-7.

R.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the current best evidence in decision-making for the care of patients. Teaching best evidence practice in residency should include both formal or freestanding content, as well as integration into clinical scenarios and patient care. We sought to assess the attitudes, experience and knowledge of EBM in urology residency training across Canada. METHODS: An anonymous, cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire was completed by a convenience sample of 29 residents, including all chief urology residents in English-speaking programs across Canada. The survey included both open-ended and closed-ended questions designed to assess familiarity and attitudes towards EBM and potential barriers to developing EBM skills in a surgical training program. Questions were formatted to determine the understanding of statistical and analytical concepts, as well as familiarity of available EBM resources. Descriptive and correlative statistics were used to analyze the responses. RESULTS: The response rate was 100%. An overwhelming majority of residents felt that EBM is an important component of the urology residency and journal club was the most common vehicle for discussing best evidence concepts. However, there was significant variation in the presence of freestanding, formal curricula across programs, with only 28% of residents signifying that they received any formal training in their program. The apparent level of understanding of important EBM terminology and resources appears to be limited. The most frequently stated barriers to incorporating EBM curricula into urology training were time constraints and a perceived lack of expert educators. CONCLUSION: This self-report survey of urology chief residents identified the overwhelming acceptance of the importance of EBM in their training. Although best evidence practices appears to be addressed in journal clubs and in real-life clinical experiences, the obvious lack of familiarity and understanding of EBM content and resources would suggest a need for redoubling efforts to ensure appropriate exposure and instruction in our training programs.","1920-1214     Roth, Kirk     Siemens, D Robert     Journal Article     Canada     Can Urol Assoc J. 2010 Apr;4(2):114-20.

From July 1982 through June 1987, 38,714 patients were evaluated for injuries in the emergency department. Five thousand sixty-one patients required admission to the hospital, and of these, 2,045 were admitted to the intensive care unit. In addition, 3,851 major trauma operations were performed during this 5-year period. The majority of these procedures were neurosurgical and orthopedic; however, we have seen an increasing percentage of abdominal operations in the last 2 years. The last five graduating chief residents averaged 181 major trauma operations during their training. The hospital currently writes off an average of $250,000 per month in trauma patient non-collections. This averages to 1.5 million dollars per resident for 5 years of trauma education in our institution.

Most program evaluation consists of numerical rating scales from which it is often difficult to pinpoint exact sources of dissatisfaction. METHODS: Our goal in this work is to evaluate the utility of focus group methodology to uncover in detail the reasons for residents' deteriorating morale in an IM residency program, as well as to solicit suggestions for correction. This study employed focus groups (FG) in a qualitative research design, in which descriptive statistics from a resident program evaluation survey served to guide an intensive focus group process. Participants were 40 of 45 2nd and 3rd year internal medicine residents enrolled in the IM residency training program. Five chief residents were trained to conduct 5 focus groups with 8 residents in each group. The focus groups examined possible issues contributing to the deterioration of morale noted in the quantitative survey. RESULTS: Many unexpected themes were uncovered by the FGs. Residents identified the following factors as the major contributors to deteriorating morale: 1) Pace of change 2) Process of change 3) The role of chief residents in change 4) Fear of intimidation and retaliation. Groups also suggested practical recommendations for improving the culture of the residency. CONCLUSION: Introducing change in residency training is a challenging process. Respectful attention to resident frustrations and solution-focused discussions are necessary to understand and improve morale. Focus groups proved to be a useful tool in revealing the precise source of pervasive resident concerns as well as providing potential solutions. In addition, FGs methodology can be adapted in a practical manner to residency evaluation.","1472-6920     Rucker, Lloyd     Shapiro, Johanna     Fornwalt, Cliff     Hundal, Keenu     Reddy, Swapna     Singson, Zarema     Trieu, Khanh     Journal Article     England     BMC Med Educ. 2014 Jul 3;14:132. doi: 10.1186/1472-6920-14-132.

However, there is little guidance on how programs should implement a curriculum focused on high value, cost-conscious care (HVCCC). We surveyed pediatric chief residents across the country between April-June 2017 using the Association of Pediatric Program Directors (APPD) chief resident Listserv. Our survey addressed two primary questions 1) How, if at all, are pediatric residency programs teaching HVCCC concepts to residents? 2) Are pediatric chief residents satisfied with their HVCCC training? We received responses from 131 of 495 pediatric chief residents (26%). This group was of similar demographic breakdown to the national cohort of pediatric chief residents with regard to academic versus community affiliation and regional location (P = .08, 0.47). The majority of chief residents (85%) reported receiving no formal training in HVCCC during residency despite most (89%) believing formal HVCCC training should be included in residency. The majority of chief residents (53.8%) were not comfortable practicing HVCCC. Factors associated with satisfaction with HVCCC training included access to cost data (P = .047), use of an electronic medical record (P = .04) and receiving any form of formal HVCCC training. The most frequently identified major barriers to the practice of HVCCC were lack of administrative support (67%), lack of training (59%) and fear of missing a diagnosis. Our findings, although limited by small sample size, indicate that the majority of pediatric chief residents did not receive formal training in HVCCC during residency and feel unequipped to practice HVCCC. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating formal training in HVCCC into pediatric residencies. Ultimately, educating residents in HVCCC can hopefully lead to high quality care while reducing unnecessary cost that continues to plaque the US healthcare system.","L623224711     2018-07-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

There was no statistically significant change in the number of FYCR positions during this time period. Family practice fellowships existed in 63% of programs. The major justifications for the position were administrative assistance, clinical instruction, and faculty development. Most FYCRs were funded through institutional salary lines or patient care revenue. Inpatient and outpatient clinical attending responsibilities were held by most FYCRs and increasingly, FYCRs are involved in faculty development training.

20171700,Decreasing electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate surgical volume during graduate medical education training is associated with increased surgical adverse events,2010,1,1,J Urol,0022-5347 (Print) 0022-5347,183,4,1515-9,"Sandhu, J. S. and Jaffe, W. I. and Chung, D. E. and Kaplan, S. A. and Te, A. E.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: In the United States the numbers of electrosurgical transurethral prostate resection procedures have been decreasing. Since electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate is a difficult procedure to master, we hypothesized that recent residents are lacking in training for this procedure. We used summary case log information provided by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to determine if the number of electrosurgical transurethral prostate resection procedures performed by graduating chief residents has decreased and if there has been an increase in surgical adverse events. In addition, we investigated whether the increased number of laser procedures impacted the rate of adverse events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Summary operative data from graduating chief resident case logs were provided by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for academic years 2001 to 2007. The numbers of electrosurgical transurethral prostate resection procedures, laser procedures and procedures for adverse events were recorded for each year. RESULTS: The number of electrosurgical transurethral prostate resection procedures performed by graduating chief residents has steadily decreased from 58 in 2001 to 43 in 2007. Conversely the number of laser procedures started increasing in 2004. The rate of procedures for adverse events as a percentage of electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate procedures increased during the study period (from 3% in 2001 to 6% in 2007), and as a percentage of electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate and laser procedures the rate increased until 2005 and subsequently started decreasing. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of surgical adverse events, as measured by the need for subsequent procedures, has increased during the last 7 years. However, when laser procedures are accounted for, it appears that adverse events have recently started trending down as an increasing number of laser procedures started being performed.","1527-3792     Sandhu, Jaspreet S     Jaffe, William I     Chung, Doreen E     Kaplan, Steven A     Te, Alexis E     Journal Article     United States     J Urol. 2010 Apr;183(4):1515-9. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2009.12.025.

The survey serves as a tool for gathering information, sharing ideas, and voicing opinions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was made available to the chief residents from 187 training programs in North America. Questions were presented in multiple-choice and free response formats, designed to address many issues ranging from program structure to on-call policies, changes for the new board examination format and fellowships, and the effects of health care reform on radiology practices. The results of the survey were tabulated and responses to the repeated questions were compared with those from earlier surveys dating to 2003. RESULTS: Among those surveyed, 185 individual responses representing 135 unique programs were completed, yielding a 73% response rate. Thirty-eight percent of programs responded from the northeast and 17% of programs responded from the southeast. Nineteen percent of responses were from central United States, 14% of responses were from western United States, and 12% of responses were from Canada. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increasing number of programs, which cover more hospitals, during the past decade. There are more programs providing ultrasound and magnetic resonance services after hours, with an associated increase in after-hours attending physician coverage.

1858048,The impact of a resident-directed survey on the education curriculum of a university surgical training program,1991,1,1,Surgery,,110,2,405-10,"Schirmer, W. J. and Galat, J. A. and Morris, J. B. and Persons, M. L. and Shuck, J. M.",,eng,,,"Surgical training programs use various objective and subjective means to evaluate housestaff performance. However it is less clear how to assess the quality of the educational experience the program itself provides. This study examines the use of a resident-directed survey as a means of identifying and rectifying weakness in a surgical training curriculum. Multiple choice questionnaires covering each of 14 senior rotations were prepared by chief residents and distributed to all senior surgical residents in April 1989 (year I). The survey covered factors considered vital to resident education, including operative experience, input into preoperative and postoperative decisions, autonomy, and time demands, and an overall rating (OR) of the educational quality of the rotations. Responses were numerically graded: 1, appropriate; 0, fair; -1, inadequate (or ""excessive"" for the variable ""time demands""). The results, which were presented and discussed at a departmental retreat that spring, prompted specific curriculum changes for the 1989-1990 academic year. An identical survey was conducted the next spring (year II). Major reorganizational changes were made in three of the four negatively rated rotations from year I. The OR for each of the rotations improved dramatically in year II (average increase of 0.64/rotation; p less than 0.05). None of the eight favorably rated rotations in year I suffered a reduction in OR as a result of the changes. Case load, intraoperative involvement, and input in both preoperative and postoperative decisions correlated most frequently with favorable ORs in both years. This study shows that a resident survey is an effective tool for critically assessing the education curriculum of a surgical training program.","Schirmer, W J     Galat, J A     Morris, J B     Persons, M L     Shuck, J M     Journal Article     United States     Surgery. 1991 Aug;110(2):405-10.

"","Jeepers creepers, what about those epers?: Creating a culture of physician event reporting",2016,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,31,2,S287-S288,"Schmidt, J. M. and Adams, J. and Fletcher, K.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L72288496,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Adverse event (AE) reporting is an essential part of patient safety. However, literature shows physicians are less likely than other healthcare specialties to report such events. Knowledge of how to report as well as the time reporting requires are commonly cited as event reporting barriers. This quality improvement project seeks to increase the reporting rate among Internal Medicine residents. METHODS: Participants were Internal Medicine residents in an academic program rotating at the VA hospital. Baseline data on knowledge and perception of event reporting was collected via survey. Questions were Yes/No, free response or utilized a Likert scale (anchors 1 = very unlikely, 5 = very likely). Data specific to VA event reporting: Electronic Patient Event Report (ePER) was collected (at baseline and after each PDSA cycle) from VA rotating residents using a three question yes/no survey. Interventions included educational presentations, posters and emails, increased event reporting discussion at daily resident case conferences, ePER completion demonstration and feedback on actions resulting from ePERs. Each month long PDSA cycle built on the previous months' cycles. By the third month, residents were receiving an email at the start of their rotation detailing how and where to file an ePER, posters were hung in resident team rooms and ePER discussion as well as simulation were included in daily didactics. Analysis was done with Chi-square test (P < 0.05) and run charts. RESULTS: Baseline data showed that 24 and 54%of residents had witnessed an adverse event or near miss (NM) during their last rotation at the VA. Forty-nine and 22 % of residents would report an AE or NM if witnessed. However, only 3 % had ever filed an event report at the VA. Residents cited Time (45 %), Don't know how (43 %) and Don't think change will occur (30 %) as reasons why they are unlikely to report. Preliminary data analysis of monthly surveys after three PDSA cycles shows a statistically significant increase across all questions (see Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: Upon completion of three PDSA cycles, we were able to increase resident physician awareness of and participation in event reporting at our institution. While this intervention required consistent effort, it is clearly sustainable because it involved a small amount of educational time. We believe that the main effect from this intervention came through increasing discussions of ePERs in the context of other ongoing conferences. The chief residents made a commitment to take every opportunity in informal and formal settings to suggest the filing of an ePER, when appropriate. We see this as the beginning of a culture change in our program that involves the residents having a more active role in patient safety. Plans to sustain this momentum include completing a final PDSA cycle with presentation on a formally conducted Root Cause Analysis (RCA) that resulted from an ePER filed by a resident. This presentation will be incorporated into a regular morbidity and mortality conference. Also part of the final PDSA cycle will be using 5-10 min at noon reports throughout the month to update the residents on actions spurred from other ePERs. We plan to spread this successful intervention to our affiliates in the coming academic year. (Table Presented).","L72288496     2016-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Although pediatric providers are a critical point of contact for suicide risk screening, triage, and intervention, little is known about the content or perceived adequacy of suicide risk assessment and management training practices in pediatric residency programs. OBJECTIVE: Among pediatric program directors (PDs) and chief residents (CRs), to (1) characterize training practices in pediatric residency programs nationwide, and (2) evaluate areas of training need to guide curriculum development. METHODS: An IRB-approved, cross-sectional, anonymous survey of all pediatric residency PDs and CRs was distributed online through the Association of Pediatric Program Directors listservs from May to June 2017. The 24-item survey was developed through expert consensus to assess training practices and perceived needs in suicide risk assessment and management training. We calculated descriptive statistics for all variables. RESULTS: A total of 95/204 PDs and 210/494 CRs completed the survey. Although 82% of respondents believed suicide risk assessment and management training was very or extremely important, only 18% of PDs and 10% of CRs reported adequate preparation relative to training need. Forty-five percent of PDs and 66% of CRs endorsed formal training (PD median = 3 hours [IQR 1-4.5 hours], CR median = 1.5 hours [IQR 0-3 hours]), which was provided across diverse rotations and not always mandatory. Only 20% of PDs and 10% of CRs reported use of a clinical practice guideline or policy document to guide clinical practice. PDs and CRs agreed on top-ranked educational priorities including interviewing adolescents about risk, identifying suicide risk factors, and locating relevant community resources; perceived barriers included limited time for training, lack of training resources, and need for additional expert faculty to guide training. CONCLUSIONS: PDs and CRs endorsed a need for improved guidance in suicide risk assessment and management education, which may benefit from programmatic curricular changes to enhance medical education and guide suicide prevention efforts.","L623224256     2018-07-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The CR performed a complete otolaryngologic examination, including fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy. The CR and LBCO viewed the examination on a video monitor; the RBCO viewed the same image on the video-conferencing monitor. Each physician independently recorded findings and rendered a diagnosis. A third board-certified otolaryngologist, who reviewed the stored data file (text and stored images) in a delayed fashion (DBCO), documented his findings and made a diagnosis. RESULTS: The CR and LBCO agreed on diagnosis in 92% (36 of 39) of cases. The LBCO and RBCO arrived at the same diagnosis in 29 of 34 (85%) cases. The DBCO agreed with the LBCO for 18 of 28 (64%) diagnoses. Agreement on management recommendations between the LBCO/DBCO pair were also lower than for the LBCO/RBCO pair. CONCLUSIONS: Both interactive and delayed techniques can be used to provide relatively accurate clinical consultations in otolaryngology. Telemedicine can be applied for subspecialty consultations, screening programs, remote emergency triage, second opinions, and resident education.","Sclafani, A P     Heneghan, C     Ginsburg, J     Sabini, P     Stern, J     Dolitsky, J N     Clinical Trial     Comparative Study     Journal Article     Randomized Controlled Trial     England     Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1999 Jan;120(1):62-72. doi: 10.1016/S0194-5998(99)70371-2.

C.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: The interview process is a pivotal, differentiating component of the residency match. Our bias is toward a working interview, producing better fulfillment of the needs of both parties, and a more informed match selection for the candidates and program. METHODS: We describe a ""candidate-centered"" approach for integrating applicant interviews into our daily work schedule. Applicants are informed upon accepting the interview of the working interview model. Our program offers 33 interview days over a 12-week period. A maximum of 5 applicants are hosted per day. Applicants are assigned to 1 of our general, thoracic, vascular, or plastic surgery teams. The interview day begins with the applicant changing into scrubs, attending a morning conference, and taking part in a program overview by a Chief Resident. Applicants join their host team where 4-8 hours are spent observing the operative team, on rounds and sharing lunch. The faculty and senior residents are responsible for interviewing and evaluating applicants though the Electronic Residency Application Service. RESULTS: A total of 13 surgeons are involved in the interview process resulting in broad-based evaluations. Each surgeon interviewed between 3 and 12 applicants. Faculty rate this interview approach highly because it allows them to maintain a rigorous operative schedule while interacting with applicants. Current residents are engaged in welcoming applicants to view the program. Faculty and residents believe cooperating in a real world manner aids their assessment of the applicant. Applicants routinely provide positive feedback, relaying this approach is informative, transparent, and should be the ""standard."" Applicants believe they are presented a realistic view of the program. Ultimately, this candidate-centered process may be attributable to our resident cohort who exhibit high satisfaction, excellent resident morale, and very low dropout rate. CONCLUSIONS: We present a candidate-centered, working interview approach used in the selection of general surgery residents. While it may require more resources than the traditional approach, it harbors advantages for the applicant and the program.","1878-7452     Seabott, Heather     Smith, Ryan K     Alseidi, Adnan     Thirlby, Richard C     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2012 Nov-Dec;69(6):802-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2012.06.004.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2015 Thoracic Surgery Directors Association Survey administered to all thoracic surgical residents taking the yearly In-Service Training Examination (n = 356). Residents were asked whether they routinely served as the operative surgeon on various cardiac operations and operative tasks. Results were stratified by postgraduate year (PGY), residency type, and primary career interest. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 100%. Considering all training pathways, only 2 of 13 cardiac operations surveyed were routinely performed by graduating chief residents as the operative surgeon: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; 92%) and aortic valve replacement (AVR; 88%). Off-pump CABG, minimally invasive mitral valve operation, and transcatheter aortic interventions were infrequently (<30% of the time) performed by graduating residents as the operative surgeon. These results were similar when residents with a career interest in general thoracic surgery were excluded from the analysis. For the operative progression of integrated 6-year (I-6) residents, most began to routinely cannulate for cardiopulmonary bypass, perform proximal coronary anastomoses, and harvest the mammary artery during PGY3. The majority (>50%) of I-6 residents performed CABG as the operative surgeon by PGY4. CONCLUSIONS: There is pronounced heterogeneity in the cardiac operative experience of cardiothoracic surgical residents in the United States, with only CABG and AVR routinely performed by graduating residents as the operative surgeon. This heterogeneity may lead to insufficient training in certain procedures for many graduates.","1552-6259     Shah, Asad A     Aftab, Muhammad     Tchantchaleishvili, Vakhtang     LaPar, Damien J     Stephens, Elizabeth H     Walters, Dustin M     DeNino, Walter F     Odell, David D     Robich, Michael     Cevasco, Marisa     Eilers, Amanda L     Gillaspie, Erin A     Goldstone, Andrew     Malas, Tarek     Rice, Robert D     Shelstad, Ryan C     Andersen, Nicholas D     Journal Article     Netherlands     Ann Thorac Surg. 2016 Jun;101(6):2341-9. doi: 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.12.069.

This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using this method to assess medical students working on an inter-professional surgical care team. Methodology: We conducted a pilot study to develop and implement an MSF instrument designed to assess the day-to-day clinical performance of third-year medical students as observed by physicians, nurses, peers, patients and adminstrators. Assessment items were aligned with the CanMEDS competencies for physicians. The instrument was piloted on groups of 20-24 students completing the clerkship every 2 months. The data gathered was used to generate a one-page report for each student summarizing their performance. Structured feedback was obtained at meetings with students and assessors. Results: Each student had an average of 25 assessments completed over 6 weeks (physician 8, patient 6, nurse 4, peer 3, chief resident 2, self 1, administrator 1). This represented approximately 250 assessment items and 25 narrative comments per student. Students and assessors expressed some concern over the validity of individual assessments compared to the more traditional preceptor-based assessment. Conclusion and Discussion: This study is the first to demonstrate that the use of multi-source feedback is feasible in undergraduate medical education. We plan to define its advantages and limitations in more detail in further studies. We anticipate that MSF will prove to be a valuable tool which may prove useful in other learning environments employing a team-based approach to learning.","L71975025     2015-08-25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

METHOD: A questionnaire asking about training and competency in 31 core procedures for family medicine (FM) was developed from the literature and pilot tested on residency directors for face validity and clarity. The questionnaires were mailed to chief residents at the 463 FM residency programs in the United States between July and October 2001. RESULTS: A total of 265 (57%) questionnaires were returned. Ninety-six percent of respondents were PGY3 seconds, and 40% were women. All residents had performed excision of a lesion, drainage of an abscess, and simple suturing. Residents were least likely to have performed vasectomy (46%), thoracotomy (41%), and rigid sigmoidoscopy (34%). The mean number of procedures performed during residency and the number of procedures the resident intended to perform in practice differed by gender. Residents who planned to practice in rural areas anticipated performing more procedures than did those who planned to practice in suburban areas (20 versus 17; p >/=.001). Over 90% of residents felt competent to perform obstetrics, but fewer than 50% planned to in practice. CONCLUSION: Despite reports that core procedural skills are taught, this study suggests significant numbers of residents are not being taught certain procedures in a manner that results in residents feeling competent to perform them.","Sharp, Lisa K     Wang, Ralph     Lipsky, Martin S     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     Acad Med. 2003 Sep;78(9):926-32.

This study aimed to investigate how time flow metrics including emergency department length of stay is influenced by changes to the internal medicine consultation policy. METHOD: This study is a pre- and post-controlled interventional study. We attempted to improve the internal medicine consultation process to be more concise. After the intervention, only attending emergency physicians consult internal medicine chief residents, clinical fellows, or junior staff of each internal medicine subspecialty who were on duty when patients required special care or an admission to internal medicine. RESULTS: Emergency department length of stay of patients admitted to the department of internal medicine prior to and after the intervention decreased from 996.94min to 706.62min. The times from consultation order to admission order and admission order to emergency department departure prior to and after the intervention were decreased from 359.59min to 180.38min and from 481.89min to 362.37min, respectively. The inpatient mortality rates and Inpatient bed occupancy rates prior to and after the intervention were similar. CONCLUSION: The improvements in the internal medicine consultation process affected the flow time metrics. Therefore, more comprehensive and cooperative strategies need to be developed to reduce the time cycle metrics and overcrowding of all patients in the emergency department.","1532-8171     Shin, Sangheon     Lee, Soo Hoon     Kim, Dong Hoon     Kim, Seong Chun     Kim, Tae Yun     Kang, Changwoo     Jeong, Jin Hee     Lim, Daesung     Park, Yong Joo     Lee, Sang Bong     Journal Article     United States     Am J Emerg Med. 2018 Apr;36(4):620-624. doi: 10.1016/j.ajem.2017.09.041.

J. and Dahamna, B. and Hellot, M. F. and Weber, J. and Charlin, B.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The Script Concordance test (SC) test is an assessment tool that measures the capacity to solve ill-defined problems, that is, reasoning in a context of uncertainty. This study assesses the feasibility, reliability and validity of the SC test made available on the Web to French urologists. METHODS: A 97 items SC test was developed based on major educational objectives of French urology training programmes. A secure Web site was created with two sequential modules: a) The first one for the reference panel to elaborate the scoring system; b) The second for candidates with different levels of experience in urology: Board certified urologists, chief-residents, residents, medical students. All participants were recruited on a voluntary basis. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics of the participants' scores and factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) to study differences between groups' means. Reliability was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: The on line SC test has been operational since June 2004. Twenty-six faculty members constituted the reference panel. During the following 10 months, 207 participants took the test online (124 urologists, 29 chief-residents, 38 residents, 16 students). No technical problem was encountered. Forty-five percent of the participants completed the test partially only. Differences between the means scores for the 4 groups were statistically significant (P = 0.0123). The Bonferroni post-hoc correction indicated that significant differences were present between students and chief-residents, between students and urologists. There were no differences between chief-residents and urologists. Reliability coefficient was 0.734 for the total group of participants. CONCLUSION: Feasibility of Web-based SC test was proved successful by the large number of participants who participated in a few months. This Web site has permitted to quickly confirm reliability of the SC test and develop strategy to improve construct validity of the test when applied in the field of urology. Nevertheless, optimisation of the SC test content, with a smaller number of items will be necessary. Virtual medical education initiative such as this SC test delivered on the Internet warrants consideration in the current context of national pre-residency certification examination in France.","1472-6920     Sibert, Louis     Darmoni, Stefan J     Dahamna, Badisse     Hellot, Marie-France     Weber, Jacques     Charlin, Bernard     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Validation Studies     England     BMC Med Educ. 2006 Aug 28;6:45. doi: 10.1186/1472-6920-6-45.

MUS training is now a required component of physiatry residency training, but formal curriculum guidelines are not yet established. Our objective was to assess the educational value of a collaborative residency MUS training program. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) residency program. Participants: 23 residents and faculty in PM&R and rheumatology. Interventions: Residents participated in a 9-month structured MUS curriculum designed by faculty and chief residents. Every 3 months, a 4-hour hands-on MUS training session was led by a PM&R faculty MUS expert. Each session focused on 1-2 body structures with corresponding assigned reading. Prior to sessions, 5-6 resident volunteers were trained by the faculty as resident instructors who taught their peers in small group MUS training sessions (1:4 ratio). Upon session completion, residents practiced with peers, producing standardized images for review by the resident instructor and faculty. Concurrently, residents rotated with PM&R and rheumatology MUS faculty, performing diagnostic and interventional MUS under direct supervision. Main Outcome Measures: Five-point Likert scale-formatted questionnaire to assess resident-perceived value of the curriculum. Results or Clinical Course: Response rate was 87% (20/23). Self-reported MUS knowledge was compared pre- and postcurriculum implementation resulting in significant improvement (p=.001). Peer teaching was highly valued, with 70% of residents rating it very or extremely beneficial (4.0 ± 1.0). Selfguided learning, by supplemental scanning and reading, was rated beneficial or very beneficial by 80% of residents (3.1 ± 0.7). Overall, curriculum rating was good to excellent for 70% of residents (4.0 ± 0.8). Training by rheumatology faculty was found to be very or extremely beneficial by 83% of residents. Conclusions: Our structured collaborative MUS program was beneficial in the education of PM&R residents. Our pilot program can serve as a teaching model for other PM&R residency programs introducing required MUS teaching.","L71643754     2014-10-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"
10526519,Resident continuity of care experience in a Canadian general surgery training program,1999,1,1,Can J Surg,0008-428X (Print) 0008-428x,42,5,353-7,"Sidhu, R. S. and Walker, G. R.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: To provide baseline data on resident continuity of care experience, to describe the effect of ambulatory centre surgery on continuity of care, to analyse continuity of care by level of resident training and to assess a resident-run preadmission clinic's effect on continuity of care. DESIGN: Data were prospectively collected for 4 weeks. All patients who underwent a general surgical procedure were included if a resident was present at operation. SETTING: The Division of General Surgery, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont. OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative, operative and inhospital postoperative involvement of each resident with each case was recorded. RESULTS: Residents assessed preoperatively (before entering the operating room) 52% of patients overall, 20% of patients at the ambulatory centre and 83% of patients who required emergency surgery. Of patients assessed by the chief resident, 94% were assessed preoperatively compared with 32% of patients assessed by other residents (p < 0.001). Of the admitted patients, 40% had complete resident continuity of care (preoperative, operative and postoperative). There was no statistical difference between this rate and that for emergency, chief-resident and non-chief-resident subgroups. Of the eligible patients, 58% were seen preoperatively by the resident on the preadmission clinic service compared with 54% on other services (p < 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: This study serves as a reference for the continuity of care experience in Canadian surgical programs. Residents assessed only 52% of patients preoperatively, and only 40% of patients had complete continuity of care. Factors such as ambulatory surgery and junior level of training negatively affected continuity experience. Such factors must be taken into account in planning surgical education.","Sidhu, R S     Walker, G R     Comparative Study     Journal Article     Canada     Can J Surg. 1999 Oct;42(5):353-7.

To my knowledge, no research to date has described the attributes of journal clubs associated with high resident attendance and the avoidance of periodic abandonment. I sought to determine how journal clubs in postgraduate programs in internal medicine are organized and to identify the features associated with high attendance and continuous existence. METHODS: Mailed cross-sectional survey of the 208 accredited residency programs in internal medicine in the eastern United States. The surveys were mailed to the chief resident in internal medicine in August 1992. RESULTS: Data from 131 residency programs were available (response rate, 64.5%). Mean estimated attendance at the 124 programs with an active journal club was 58.5% (range, 7% to 100%); 86 (65.6%) of the clubs were in continuous existence for 2 years or longer. Fifty-two journal clubs (41.9%) were described as independent of any faculty clubs, and 62 (50.0%) emphasized original research. The number of articles reviewed per session ranged from one to six, but the majority reviewed two articles, usually during a 1-hour period, most often during the lunch hour. Seventy-two programs (58.1%) described club attendance as mandatory. The provision of food was a regular feature of 83 (66.9%) of the journal clubs, and the majority of clubs with food regularly rely on funding support for the food from pharmaceutical companies. Participation of faculty in the scheduling of the club, assigning articles, and overall coordination varied, but in 29 (22.1%) of the clubs, faculty provided formal teaching of critical appraisal skills, clinical epidemiology, and biostatistics. Fewer house staff, a mandatory attendance requirement, being independent of a faculty journal club, and formal teaching were associated with high attendance. The regular provision of food was associated with long, continuous existence. Reviewing only original research articles was associated with long, continuous existence but was negatively associated with high attendance. Journal clubs with both long, continuous existence and high attendance were associated with mandatory attendance, the provision of food, and fewer house staff. CONCLUSIONS: If residency journal club success is defined as having high attendance or long, continuous existence, then success is associated with smaller residency programs, making attendance mandatory, promoting a journal club independent of faculty, providing formal teaching of critical appraisal skills, making food available, and emphasizing original research articles. Residency programs in internal medicine seeking to establish journal clubs with long, continuous existence or high attendance should focus on these attributes.","Sidorov, J     Journal Article     United States     Arch Intern Med. 1995 Jun 12;155(11):1193-7.

S. and Chang, B.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Efforts to standardize hand surgery training during plastic surgery residency remain challenging. We analyze the variability of operative hand experience at U.S. plastic surgery residency programs. METHODS: Operative case logs of chief residents in accredited U.S. plastic surgery residency programs were analyzed (2011-2015). Trends in fold differences of hand surgery case volume between the 10th and 90th percentiles of residents were assessed graphically. Percentile data were used to calculate the number of residents achieving case minimums in hand surgery for 2015. RESULTS: Case logs from 818 plastic surgery residents were analyzed of which a minority were from integrated (35.7%) versus independent/combined (64.3%) residents. Trend analysis of fold differences in case volume demonstrated decreasing variability among procedure categories over time. By 2015, fold differences for hand reconstruction, tendon cases, nerve cases, arthroplasty/arthrodesis, amputation, arterial repair, Dupuytren release, and neoplasm cases were below 10-fold. Congenital deformity cases among independent/combined residents was the sole category that exceeded 10-fold by 2015. Percentile data suggested that approximately 10% of independent/combined residents did not meet case minimums for arterial repair and congenital deformity in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: Variable operative experience during plastic surgery residency may limit adequate exposure to hand surgery for certain residents. Future studies should establish empiric case minimums for plastic surgery residents to ensure hand surgery competency upon graduation.","1878-7452     Silvestre, Jason     Lin, Ines C     Levin, Lawrence Scott     Chang, Benjamin     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2017 Jul - Aug;74(4):650-655. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.12.001.

METHODS: The American Medical Association provided data on career intentions of surgical chief residents graduating from 2014 to 2016. The percentage of residents pursuing fellowship training was compared by specialty. Trends in the proportion of accredited fellowship programs in craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, and microsurgery were analyzed. The percentage of accredited programs was compared between subspecialties with added-certification options (hand surgery) and subspecialties without added-certification options (craniofacial surgery and microsurgery). RESULTS: Most integrated and independent plastic surgery residents pursued fellowship training (61.8 percent versus 49.6 percent; p = 0.014). Differences existed by specialty from a high in orthopedic surgery (90.8 percent) to a low in colon and rectal surgery (3.2 percent).

"",Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Radiation Oncology Training: From a Residents Perspective,2014,1,1,Oncology,,28,1,"","Singhvi, M. and Taw, M. and Lee, S. P.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L75006154,English,,,"Background: Todays health care system is evolving in its approach to the management of an ethnically diverse population, as it continues to struggle with the imperative of providing cost-effective care. Up to 90% of patients report utilizing some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), such as supplements, acupuncture, or meditation, during their cancer journey. Integrative medicine (IM) is a field of study seeking to combine these nonconventional approaches with conventional methods to patient care by focusing on the least invasive, least toxic, and least costly methods to facilitate overall health. Despite the ubiquity of CAM, such teachings are not adequately covered in radiation oncology training programs. The glaring deficiency in education adversely affects both patients, as they seek optimal holistic care, and clinicians, as they begin their independent careers. This study attempts to assess the level of knowledge and interest current residents have in CAM teachings, with the goal of eventually incorporating such evidence-based study into training curriculum. Methods: A seven-question survey was developed, and study design was approved by the UCLA institutional review board (IRB). The questionnaire was electronically delivered through a free portal to radiation oncology chief residents across the country, with a request to disseminate the same amongst their colleagues. All trainees in the discipline were requested to participate. The aim of the study and the fact that participation was voluntary and that responses would be kept anonymous were explicated in the introduction. Aggregate data were downloaded and compiled. Results: Completed surveys from 145 of 577 total trainees were received, representing 51 of 87 accredited residency programs. Half of all respondents felt that their patients did not feel comfortable seeking their advice on the subject, and 70% did not consider themselves adequately informed on CAM for their professional work. Overall, 85% residents harbor an interest in IM, and about 75% wish to learn more during residency training. Discussion: To our knowledge, this study provides the first national assessment of trainee attitudes toward CAM, as previous studies have focused more broadly on medical students or practicing health care providers. As a substantial percentage of participants are interested in but not sufficiently educated on this subject, there is a need for formal training to be incorporated in our curriculum. Limitations of this study include the small number of total participants, with the question of whether or not this group is representative of the entire specialty. Additionally, findings regarding educational activities are inherently subject to memory bias. The current Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) program requirement for graduate medical education (GME) in radiation oncology has no mention of CAM. Academic programs are engines of innovation in education, with a mandate to produce well-rounded clinicians. Therefore, it is trainees who are in the best position to learn the evidence behind CAM techniques and safely integrate these approaches with current standards of care. The Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine may be an appropriate place to start, as it has developed a variety of targeted modules currently being employed at roughly 45 primary care training programs across the country.","L75006154     2014-05-15 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

I. and Flynn, T. C. and Silver, M. and Behrns, K. E.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To design and implement a multidisciplinary systems-based practice learning experience that is focused on improving and standardizing the preoperative quality of care for general surgical patients. DESIGN: Four parameters of preoperative care were designated as quality assessment variables, including bowel preparation, perioperative beta-blockade, prophylactic antibiotic use, and deep venous thrombosis prevention. Four groups of general surgery residents (PGY I-V), each led by 1 chief resident, were assigned a quality parameter, performed an evidence-based current literature review, and formulated a standardized management approach based on the level of evidence and recommendations available. Because preoperative preparation includes anesthetic care and operating room preparation, we presented our findings at the Department of Surgery Grand Rounds in a multidisciplinary format that included presentations by each resident group, the Department of Anesthesia, the Department of Medicine, and the Department of Nursing. The aim of the multidisciplinary quality assurance conference was to present the evidence-based literature findings in order to determine how standardization of preoperative care would alter anesthetic and nursing care, and to obtain feedback about management protocols. To determine the educational impact of this model of integrated systems-based practice quality assessment on the teaching experience, residents were queried regarding the value of this educational venue and responses were rated on a Likert scale. RESULTS: Resident participation was excellent. The residents garnered valuable information by performing a literature review and evaluating the best preoperative preparation given each parameter. Furthermore, integration of their findings into systems-based practice including anesthesia and nursing care provided an appreciation of the complexities of care as well as the associated need for appropriate medical knowledge, communication, and professionalism. The derivation of treatment protocols included an opportunity to incorporate several competencies across multiple disciplines. The residents evaluated 5 questions and deemed the educational exercise an effective model to enrich surgical resident education while simultaneously improving patient care. The residents also strongly agreed that they would participate in similar projects in the future as well as recommend this educational exercise to other residents. A finalized preoperative order set was created and distributed to all residents for use in the preoperative care of general surgery patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our multidisciplinary systems-based practice learning experience focused on improving and standardizing the preoperative quality of care for patients, and general surgery residents were pivotal participants in that process. This exercise had a positive impact on our general surgery residency education program and proved to be a valuable model of systems-based practice competency.","Siri, Jean     Reed, Alan I     Flynn, Timothy C     Silver, Michele     Behrns, Kevin E     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2007 Nov-Dec;64(6):328-32. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2007.05.002.

Discharge summaries lacked timely completion. Faculty were cited for 772 (10.3%) delinquent summaries (>30 days after discharge) in one year due to resident delays in dictating summaries. Only 27% were completed within 24 hours of discharge. PCPs and families cited frustration due to delays in discharge summaries at follow up. AIM STATEMENT: By December of 2016, greater than 50% of discharge summaries will be completed within 24 hours of discharge. In addition, we will reduce the number of delinquent discharge summaries >30 days to less than 1% and reduce the duration of time to complete charting on the day of discharge by 50%. Interventions We developed and implemented a discharge summary template in EPIC to replace dictated summaries. This effort was University of Connecticut Pediatric Chief Resident led and involved interdisciplinary collaboration at CT Children's Medical Center. The working group consisted of residents, faculty, community PCPs, families, IT, legal, billing & coding, risk management and regulatory compliance. It was a biweekly, 6-month process including building a template in EPIC EMR, pilot trial (May 2016), then full implementation (June 2016). There was training on the electronic template and Dragon Voice Activated Software. The discharge summary served as the billable progress note for the day of discharge. MEASURES: Time for summary creation was tracked in EPIC. Time of completion from discharge, overall compliance and delinquencies were tracked by HIM. Resident and faculty feedback was collected from focus groups. Results The percentage of summaries completed within 24 hours increased from 27% to 54% after going live. The number of delinquent summaries was reduced from 772 (10.3%, n = 7493) to 3 (0.04%, n = 7529) in the year before and after implementation. The time for creating the summary and final progress note combined was reduced from 20 minutes to 5 minutes on average. Residents, faculty and PCPs reported universal satisfaction starting immediately with full implementation, faculty noted additional professional and personal time, and there were no family complaints. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS: We were able to design an efficient and effective discharge summary that improved timely handover to PCPs, reduced delinquencies and increased provider time for meaning in work. Next steps are to further improve discharge timeliness and to revise our EPIC daily progress note to improve timely completion and improve consistency of information shared.

DESIGN: Firm-based, controlled trial. SETTING: Urban public hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five first-year internal medicine residents: 18 in the experimental group and 37 in the control group. INTERVENTION: An EBM course, taught 2 hours per week for 7 consecutive weeks by senior faculty and chief residents focusing on the four essential EBM skills. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was performance on an EBM skills test that was administered four times over 11 months: at baseline and at three time points postcourse. Postcourse test 1 assessed the effectiveness of the intervention in the experimental group (primary outcome]; postcourse test 2 assessed the control group after it crossed over to receive the intervention; and postcourse test 3 assessed durability. Baseline EBM skills were similar in the two groups. After receiving the EBM course, the experimental group achieved significantly higher postcourse test scores (adjusted mean difference, 21%; 95% confidence interval, 13% to 28%; P < .001). Postcourse improvements were noted in three of the four EBM skill domains (formulating questions, searching, and quantitative understanding [P < .005 for all], but not in critical appraisal skills [P = .4]). After crossing over to receive the educational intervention, the control group achieved similar improvements. Both groups sustained these improvements over 6 to 9 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A brief structured educational intervention produced substantial and durable improvements in residents' cognitive and technical EBM skills.","Smith, C A     Ganschow, P S     Reilly, B M     Evans, A T     McNutt, R A     Osei, A     Saquib, M     Surabhi, S     Yadav, S     Clinical Trial     Controlled Clinical Trial     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Gen Intern Med. 2000 Oct;15(10):710-5.

22086474,Residents contributing to inpatient quality: blending learning and improvement,2012,1,1,J Hosp Med,1553-5592,7,2,148-53,"Smith, K. L. and Ashburn, S. and Rule, E. and Jervis, R.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Quality improvement (QI) initiatives reduce medical errors and are an important aspect of resident physician training. Many institutions have limited funding and few QI experts, making it essential to develop effective programs that require only modest resources. We describe a resident-led, hospitalist-facilitated limited root cause analysis (RCA) QI program developed to meet training needs and institutional constraints. METHODS: We initiated a monthly quality improvement conference (QIC) at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, New York. Before each conference, a third-year resident investigated a patient care issue and completed a limited RCA. At the QIC, the findings were presented to the Internal Medicine residents, followed by a chief resident and hospitalist-facilitated group discussion. All proposed interventions were recorded, and selected interventions were later implemented. The success of these interventions in achieving permanent system-wide change or resident behavior change was tracked. Residents' views on the conferences were solicited via an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty conferences were held over the first 22 months of the program. Twenty-five (54%) of the 46 suggested interventions were initiated. Eighteen (72%) attempted interventions resulted in system-wide change or resident behavior change. Fifty-three residents evaluated the quality of the conferences. The majority believed the conferences were high quality (98%) and led to patient care improvements (96%). CONCLUSIONS: Resident-led modified RCAs are an effective method of integrating QI efforts into resident training. As front line providers, residents are uniquely positioned to identify and implement system changes that benefit patients. Conferences were implemented without overburdening facilitators or participants.","1553-5606     Smith, Kristofer L     Ashburn, Sarah     Rule, Erin     Jervis, Ramiro     Journal Article     United States     J Hosp Med. 2012 Feb;7(2):148-53. doi: 10.1002/jhm.945.

23111042,Impact of implementation of a pediatric surgery fellowship on general surgery resident operative volume,2012,1,1,J Surg Educ,1878-7452,69,6,753-8,"Snyder, R. A. and Phillips, S. E. and Terhune, K. P.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the initiation of a pediatric surgery fellowship on general surgery resident operative volume at 1 major academic institution. DESIGN: Retrospective review of operative records obtained from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) general surgery resident and pediatric surgery fellow case logs. Data collected included number and type of pediatric index cases per year, number of total pediatric surgery cases per year, and number of total cases logged as primary surgeon to date. SETTING: Vanderbilt University School of Medicine Department of Surgery, which has an accredited general surgery program, finishes 7 chief residents per year during the study period, and instituted a new pediatric surgery fellowship in 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Case logs submitted by third and fourth year general surgery residents and first and second year pediatric surgery fellows were studied. RESULTS: The number of pediatric attending surgeons, relative value units (RVUs), and hospital admissions increased from 2003 to 2011. The median number of pediatric index cases performed by a resident decreased after the onset of fellowship from 34 cases to 23.5 cases per year (p < 0.001). The median number of total cases that residents performed on the pediatric surgery rotation also decreased from 74 to 53 cases per year after onset of the fellowship (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Even with an increase in the number of attending surgeons, RVUs, and admissions, the fellowship resulted in a decrease in general surgery resident index and overall case volume in pediatric surgery. Although operative volume is only 1 measure of surgical educational value, these findings suggest that the addition of surgical fellowships affects the educational experience of general surgery residents. We recommend that residency programs establish goals and calculate any potential impact on general surgery resident case volume before initiating a new surgical fellowship.","1878-7452     Snyder, Rebecca A     Phillips, Sharon E     Terhune, Kyla P     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2012 Nov-Dec;69(6):753-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2012.03.007.

29319476,CanMEDS scholars: A national survey on urology residents' attitudes towards research during training,2018,1,1,Can Urol Assoc J,1911-6470 (Print)     1911-6470,12,4,E191-e196,"Solaja, O. and Skinner, T. A. A. and McGregor, T. B. and Siemens, D. R.",,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: Participation in scholarly activity is an important tenet of residency training and is firmly entrenched in Canada since the introduction of CanMEDS roles by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. As Canadian residency programs transition to competency-based training, it will remain important to understand how to best implement and encourage scholarly pursuits among resident trainees. The objective of this study was to understand the experiences, attitudes, and barriers that surgical residents face when pursuing research during their training. METHODS: An anonymous, cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire was administered to chief residents of all English-speaking urology programs in Canada in 2015. Questions were open- and close-ended, including an agreement score based on a five-point Likert scale. Questions addressed residents' involvement in and attitudes towards research, as well as their perceptions of the utility of research involvement during training. The residents were also asked about the support they received and potential areas to improve the attainment of this competency. Descriptive and correlative statistics were used to analyze the responses. RESULTS: There was a 100% overall response rate to the questionnaire. This study revealed that Canadian urology residents have a high rate of participation in scholarly work, with the vast majority (94%) publishing at least one manuscript with a mean of four papers. Despite this, there appeared to be significant variation in the respondent's experiences, including protected time for research. Furthermore, many residents appeared unconvinced of the importance of research involvement, with only 51% agreement that participation was important to their overall training. As well, a significant number of residents reported largely external, rather than internal, motivations for research participation, such as attaining a preferred fellowship (66% agreement). While the majority of respondents felt (66% agreement) that the scholar role was important in residency training, it would appear that significant barriers, including time and mentorship, limited the effectiveness of research participation to gain those competencies. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this self-report survey outline the significant differences in attitudes and experience towards mandatory research as a component of scholarship in Canadian urology training programs. As postgraduate medical education evolves, particularly with the uptake of competency-based medical education, programs and residents will need to address the motives and barriers to better foster academic pursuits during urology training.","Solaja, Ogi     Skinner, Thomas A A     Mcgregor, Thomas B     Siemens, D Robert     Journal Article     Canada     Can Urol Assoc J. 2018 Apr;12(4):E191-E196. doi: 10.5489/cuaj.4927.

S.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622329229,English,,,"Needs and Objectives: To create a medical marijuana (MM) educational program for residents and faculty that meets Ohio regulations stating that physicians wanting certification to recommend MM complete at least two hours of continuing medical education including diagnosing qualifying conditions, treating those conditions with MMand possible drug interaction, yet also deals with the challenge to medical professionalism by allowing them to recommend a controlled substance whose possession is illegal under federal law, has minimal evidence of clinical efficacy, and is distributed through dispensaries rather than pharmacies. Setting and Participants: The legalization of MM in Ohio in September 2018 will impact the way medical professionals practice and create challenges for medical professionalism. Because evidence-based education on MM is lacking in Ohio, we created an educational program to train residents and faculty on the use of MM. The program was designed by a pharmacist, medical education faculty, a chief resident, and the department chair. The program is performed in a university based IM residency program. Description: Providing our learners with a systematic approach to dealing with the issuesof MM will give them the tools for Ohio certification andto deal with the challenges to their professionalism. This training will include: 1. Providing information on laws and regulations regarding MM, including relevant procedures and protocols. 2. Reviewing evidence on the risks and benefits of MM. 3. Reviewing how to obtain a complete medical/social history, including illicit/recreational drug use, performing an examination and appropriate testing, and providing patients using MM with continuous medical supervision. Diagnosis should determine therapy, rather than therapy with MM determining the diagnosis. 4. Teaching about MM and drug-drug or drug-disease interactions and advising patients with psychological disease or risk factors for addiction against marijuana use. Evaluation: Learners will undergo pre and post course testing on their opinions on the use of MM and the course content. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: Key concerns for medical professionals recommending the use of MM include various unstan-dardized routes of administration, lack of oversight by the FDA, dearth of data on efficacy, absent regulation of potency, purity, and composition, risk of abuse, and side effects. Heath care professionals should justify their position on the use of MM based on evidence-based medicine and/or practice guidelines and should take on an educational leadership role in their communities.","L622329229     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

I. and Roman, S. A.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in endocrine surgery. Educational objectives have been published by the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES), but data have not been collected describing the recruitment pool, fellowship, or postfellowship experiences. METHODS: A survey was distributed to endocrine surgeons in practice <7 years and endocrine surgery fellows. Demographic, training, and practice data were collected. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 69% (46/67); 85% were practicing endocrine surgeons and 15% were fellows. In all, 72% of respondents completed an endocrine surgery fellowship, 17% completed surgical oncology, and the remaining individuals completed no fellowship. The mean age was 38 (32-49) years; 39% were women, 67% were white, 26% were Asian, 11% were Hispanic, and 2% were black. A total of 89% completed residency at academic centers. Endocrine surgery fellows performed significantly more endocrine surgery cases in residency than the average graduating chief resident. Mentorship was a critical factor in fellows' decisions to pursue endocrine surgery. Fellows graduated with a median (range) of 150 (50-300) thyroid, 80 (35-200) parathyroid, 10 (2-50) neck dissection, 13 (0-60) laparoscopic adrenal, and 3 (0-35) endocrine-pancreas. Fellows felt the least prepared in neck dissection and pancreas. Of the respondents, 76% of endocrine surgeons in practice are at academic centers, and 75% have practices where most cases are endocrine based. CONCLUSION: Exposure to endocrine surgery and mentorship are powerful factors that influence residents to pursue careers in endocrine surgery. Significant variation is found in the case distribution of fellowships with a relative paucity in neck dissection, pancreas procedures, and research. Recruitment to endocrine surgery should begin in residency, and the standardization of training should be a goal.","1532-7361     Solorzano, Carmen C     Sosa, Julie A     Lechner, Suzanne C     Lew, John I     Roman, Sanziana A     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Surgery. 2010 Apr;147(4):536-41. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2009.10.041.

C. and Cheun, C. Y.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Like their counterparts in many other nations, physicians in Singapore are tasked with providing care, conducting research, and teaching and providing leadership to junior doctors. In this paper, we describe our experience implementing the first chief residency program in Singapore. INITIATIVE: A pilot of a chief residency program was initiated in the Department of Medicine at National University Hospital in July 2008, with 1 chief resident (CR) and 2 associate CR positions. The pilot used the US model for CR training as the initial framework. CRs would assist in the orientation and integration of new residents, teach residents, promote camaraderie among residents, help resolve issues, function as a liaison to senior staff, and would be developed as potential health care leaders and physician role models. RESULTS: The CRs performed a host of administrative duties and initiated several improvements in the residency, including better practices for leave scheduling, call roster planning, and a night float system. CRs attended monthly meetings with division heads and participated in departmental strategic planning as well as professional development and leadership courses. The CR position was well regarded by the other residents, and this resulted in increased interest in identifying and addressing opportunities for improvement. The introduction of a chief residency also made the department a more attractive posting for residents and contributed to a significant increase in the number of applicants for residency rotations. CONCLUSIONS: A chief residency program can benefit residents' morale and a CR's development as a leader, and it can facilitate linkage between junior and senior hospital management that promotes active involvement in problem solving and clinical and education improvement. Support from hospital administrators and senior clinicians is essential, and mentoring and succession planning are important to ensure the program's continued success.","1949-8357     Soo, Yap Eng     Wei-Ping, Goh     Kee, Adrian C L     Cheun, Chan Yee     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2010 Sep;2(3):346-8. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-09-00094.1.

All patients who presented as a trauma alert to a single institution from August 2011 to May 2012 underwent an extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST). The thoracic cavity was examined using four-view US imaging and were interpreted by a chief resident (Postgraduate Year 4) or attending staff. US results were compared with CXR and chest computed tomography (CT) scans, when obtained. The average age was 37.8 years and 68 per cent of the patients were male. Blunt injury occurred in 87 per cent and penetrating injury in 12 per cent of activations. US was able to predict the absence of PTX on CXR with a sensitivity of 93.8 per cent, specificity of 98 per cent, and a negative predictive value of 99.9 per cent compared with CXR. The only missed PTX seen on CXR was a small, low anterior, loculated PTX that was stable for transport to CT. The use of thoracic US during the FAST can rapidly and safely detect the absence of a clinically significant PTX. US can replace routine CXR obtained in the trauma bay and allow more rapid initiation of definitive imaging studies.","1555-9823     Soult, Michael C     Weireter, Leonard J     Britt, Rebecca C     Collins, Jay N     Novosel, Timothy J     Reed, Scott F     Britt, L D     Journal Article     United States     Am Surg. 2015 Apr;81(4):336-40.

Hypothesis of this study was there is a positive correlation between mallampati score and clinician's viewing and injection difficulties during the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) blockage. Materials and methods: 150 (86 female/64 male) patients were included in this prospective, double blind study. Patients who had restricted mouth opening from any reason were excluded from the study. Mallampati airway class, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and/or snoring history were documented by same chief resident for all patients at the beginning of the appointment. Injection and viewing difficulties during the IAN anesthesia deposition and surgical procedure, latent duration for local anesthesia and total deposited anesthetic solution amount were recorded by same first year resident. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used for evaluation of viewing and injection difficulties during the IAN blockage and surgical procedure. Results were statistically evaluated by regression analysis. Results: There was a statistically significant relationship between BMI, OSA, snoring and high mallampati score (p < 0.05). Majority of the snoring problemwas observed in male patients however sleep apnea problem was approximately equal for male and female patients. There was also a statistically significant relationship between theVAS score of viewing and injection difficulty during the IAN blockage and high mallampati score (p < 0.05). Conclusions: A clinician should be aware of possible relationship between a high mallampati score and difficulty in viewing the injection location of an IAN blockage.","L70559202     2011-10-21 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

In many regions, however, there is limited availability of such personnel. We reviewed the complication rates that were related to PCNL access when performed at a teaching hospital to establish that access for PCNL may be safely taught to and performed by urology residents. Chief urology residents across the nation were also anonymously surveyed to better understand the current trends and dynamics regarding PCNL access in teaching institutions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all PCNLs performed at our institution from 1995 to 2009 for any complications that were related to surgery. Patients with access gained at outside institutions or not attempted at the time of surgery by residents were excluded. The complication rate was compared with those of the American College of Radiology. An eight-question survey was also sent by e-mail to all current urology chief residents regarding their experience with PCNL access during residency. RESULTS: A total of 290 patients underwent PCNL with 338 separate access sites gained at the time of surgery under the supervision of nine teaching staff. Access was gained in all cases at the time of surgery. Major complications included: Transfusion in 20 (5.9%) patients, sepsis in 2 (0.6%) patients, pseudoaneurysm necessitating intervention in 2 (0.6%) patients, hydrothorax in 2 (0.6%) patients, pneuomothorax in 1 (0.3%) patient, ureteropelvic junction disruption in 1 (0.3%) patient, and one death (0.3%) after surgery. Minor complications included: Urinary tract infection in five (1.5%) patients, and collecting system injuries in 6 (1.8%) patients necessitating placement of a ureteral stent. Our survey of residents demonstrated that 53% did not routinely gain access for PCNL at their institution. The 94% who did not get instruction on PCNL access, however, thought it would be a valuable addition to their training. CONCLUSION: Our results show that access for PCNL surgery can be safely and successfully obtained by genitourinary residents under the supervision of trained staff at the time of surgery. We think that access for PCNL is a valuable tool that should be in the armamentarium of all urologic surgeons on leaving an accredited urology training program.","1557-900x     Spann, Alison     Poteet, Jason     Hyatt, Dustin     Chiles, Leah     Desouza, Rowena     Venable, Dennis     Journal Article     United States     J Endourol. 2011 Sep;25(9):1421-5. doi: 10.1089/end.2010.0643.

In May 2008, a small team from Canada travelled to Romania. One of the many objectives of this trip was to perform a needs assessment of the residency education program. Although emergency medicine (EM) is a young specialty in Romania, there exists a large, nationally accredited 5-year postgraduate medical training program. At the time of the project, the EM residency in Cluj had more than 30 residents with 1 chief resident locally and a national program director in Bucharest. Methods: This needs assessment consisted of a review of the residency curriculum and access to educational resources through direct discussions with local residents, staff physicians and administrators. Results: The following problems with the local residency program were identified collaboratively: lack of a local program director and administrative assistant, no formal educational program, no formal staff mentors, no resident involvement in academic projects and poor access to EM resources. These issues were addressed both in Cluj by the Canadian team as well as in Toronto, when the Romanian ED chief and chief resident visited as part of a knowledge exchange program. Since the completion of the project, many positive changes have occurred including the designation of a local program director, introduction of a new academic half-day and improved access to EM resources. Conclusion: The issues with the Romanian EM residency in Cluj were multifactorial, involving complex organizational, cultural and resource-based problems. Despite the above, many positive changes occurred with more changes anticipated in the future.","L70511606     2011-08-26 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Design: Online survey. Setting: PM and R residency programs. Participants: Chief residents at ACGME accredited PM and R programs. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: A survey allowed statistical information to be gathered regarding the average number of resident posters/podium presentations accepted to major national yearly meetings. We also determined whether departments utilize research committees or a mandatory review process or have funding limitations and what those limitations include. Results: Forty-six of 80 programs responded. Sixteen percent of programs have 4 resident presentations accepted yearly to AAPM and R and one program more than 20. Twenty-five percent have 2 pre-sentations accepted to AAP each year. Twenty-one percent have an average of 5 presentations accepted to other conferences. Sixty percent require resident research undergo review prior to conference submission, and 37% have a committee that reviews resident research. The responsibility of 94% of the committees is only to give productive feedback/helpful recommendations. Six programs allow denial of resident research submission by someone not working with the resident. Seven programs have limitations on conference attendance. However, 78% allow residents to attend all conferences when research is accepted for presentation. Most residents use educational days from a fixed number allowed each year for conference attendance. Almost 100% of programs provide funding for attendance, most without limitation on what conference is attended. Nearly all departments cover travel, lodging, meals, and registration fees. Over half provide allotments of conference funds to residents annually, and 37% without a financial limit. Thirty-three percent receive funding outside of their department. Conclusions: Most PM and R programs provide a great deal of resources for resident research and allow for conference attendance with few limitations.","L620886447     2018-03-02 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

S. and Gupta, R. and Gracias, V. H. and Schwab, C. W.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Decisions regarding admissions/discharges in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) can potentially strain the relationship between the critical care team and the primary surgery service. We hypothesized that a multidisciplinary system of arbitration, led by an intensivist, is a safe and workable solution to SICU patient triage, which leads to consensus between critical care team and primary services. METHODS: Demographic, illness severity, readmission, and outcome data were collected prospectively on consecutive patients in a large academic center SICU. Arbitration was directed by an intensivist and a charge nurse, with regular meetings. Representation from various hospital departments (admissions, operating room, nursing, and housekeeping) was included. Decisions on patient discharge from the SICU were compared between the primary service (represented by the Chief resident) and the SICU arbitrator. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients were admitted to SICU during the 2-month study period, with 952 arbitration decisions. Good agreement exists between the primary service and the arbitrator regarding SICU patient suitability for discharge (Kappa = 0.85). Seventeen patients (5.9%) were readmitted, with 14 (82%) surviving to hospital discharge. None of the readmitted patients was originally discharged over the primary service objection. Day of discharge APACHE II scores of readmitted patients did not differ from those not readmitted (8.2 vs 7.7). Readmissions had longer hospital stays, equivalent SICU stays, and higher mortality (18%) than for patients overall (2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated intensivist, supported by a multidisciplinary team, can make arbitration decisions in the SICU that seem to be safe and generally concordant with the primary surgical team of the patient. Additional larger-scale investigation of arbitration in the SICU is warranted.","Stawicki, S Peter     Pryor, John P     Hyams, Eli S     Gupta, Rajan     Gracias, Vicente H     Schwab, C William     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2007 Sep-Oct;64(5):289-93. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2007.05.008.

O. and Siegler, E. L.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To refine the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI) and test the validity and reliability of the 9-item version (PDQI-9). METHODS: Three sets each of admission notes, progress notes and discharge summaries were evaluated by two groups of physicians using the PDQI-9 and an overall general assessment: one gold standard group consisting of program or assistant program directors (n=7), and the other of attending physicians or chief residents (n=24). The main measures were criterion-related validity (correlation coefficients between Total PDQI-9 scores and 1-item General Impression scores for each note), discriminant validity (comparison of PDQI-9 scores on notes rated as best and worst using 1-item General Impression score), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), and inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)). RESULTS: The results were criterion-related validity (r = -.678 to .856), discriminant validity (best versus worst note, t = 9.3, p = .003), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alphas = .87-.94), and inter-rater reliability (ICC = .83, CI = .72-.91). CONCLUSION: The results support the criterion-related and discriminant validity, internal consistency reliability, and inter-rater reliability of the PDQI-9 for rating the quality of electronic physician notes.

Faculty and chief resident evaluations included a written explanation and a score from 1 (honors) to 5 (failing). Oral and written examination scores were adjusted to the same numerical scale. Correlation coefficients (r) and probabilities (P) by the t test were calculated to determine validity of the components of the students' grades. In comparison with the oral examination, written examination, and final mean score, the chief residents' evaluations exhibited a validity significantly lower than that of both faculty groups (P less than 0.01). This finding was associated with the following differences in content of associated written evaluations. Residents were more likely to mention ""skills"" or ""technique"" (P less than 0.001) and less likely to comment on ""logic,"" ""judgment,"" or ""reasoning"" (P less than 0.001). Comments concerning ""appearance,"" ""enthusiasm,"" ""diligence,"" and ""motivation"" were not significantly different among these groups. Experience gained as a member of a surgical teaching faculty or by an affiliation with a teaching program resulted in a greater tendency to focus on thought processes and less emphasis on technical factors in the evaluation of the student on a surgical rotation. Education of surgical house staff must include elucidation of appropriate criteria by which students should be judged.

A.",,eng,,,"Previous studies have documented the safety and efficacy of general surgery residents and vascular fellows performing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under the supervision of an attending surgeon. With the proper supervision of the attending surgeon, these operations can be performed with an acceptably low perioperative stroke and mortality rate. The question remains, however, whether these desirable results can be obtained by general surgery residents when operating on awake patients under regional block (RB) anesthesia. We set out to determine whether it is prudent to promote this technique in this teaching setting. We analyzed 128 CEAs performed at a community teaching hospital training three chief residents a year. These operations were performed by residents under the direct supervision of a single attending vascular surgeon. RB was preferred and was used in 67 operations. General anesthesia (GA) was used in the remaining 61 procedures. Overall mortality was 0 per cent. Patients in the RB group were converted intraoperatively to GA in 4 of 67 (6%) procedures. There was one perioperative stroke in this series (1/128, 0.78%), occurring in a patient under RB (1/67, 1.5 %) leaving the patient with a minor sensory deficit. No strokes occurred in the GA group. There were five temporary cranial nerve deficits (3.9%). Three were in the RB group (4.5%) and two in the GA group (3.3%). General surgery residents can be trained in the performance of carotid endarterectomy using regional block anesthesia in awake patients without compromising patient safety. Suggestions to the effect that only attending physicians and/or vascular fellows can perform these procedures under regional block are without merit.","Stone, M E Jr     Kunjummen, B J     Moran, J C     Wilkerson, D K     Zatina, M A     Journal Article     United States     Am Surg. 2000 Aug;66(8):781-6.

This study examines the incidence of complications after rhytidectomy in the hands of chief residents under appropriate attending supervision in an otolaryngology-head and neck surgery training program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The charts of 96 consecutive SMAS rhytidectomy patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were selected for surgery from a clinic designed exclusively for cosmetic facial surgery patients. This clinic was run by the otolaryngology chief resident and was supervised by an attending staff surgeon. Most patients elected local anesthesia and sedation administered by the surgical team. Submental liposuction was performed followed by SMAS plication rhytidectomy. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 1 to 60 months. Complications included expanding hematoma (1%), temporary facial nerve weakness (3%), pretragal/mastoid skin slough (4.2%), permanent ear numbness (1%), hypertrophic scar (3.1%), wound infection (1%), and dissatisfaction with result (4%). There were no cases of permanent facial nerve injury. CONCLUSION: These complication rates compare favorably with reported rates of larger studies over the past 30 years. These data support the conclusion that rhytidectomy can be performed safely by otolaryngology residents with little morbidity and good patient satisfaction.","Sullivan, C A     Masin, J     Maniglia, A J     Stepnick, D W     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Laryngoscope. 1999 Feb;109(2 Pt 1):198-203.

The style and goals vary between institutions and across specialties, with interns and medical students variably included. Previously at our institution, a chief resident presented a formal case and residents were called on to answer questions. Faculty often overtook the discussion to share their expertise, which was challenging for junior learners. The residents asked for a more inclusive and discussion-based morning report so that all learners could actively engage without intimidation. AIM: To create a morning report that encourages active participation and collaboration among all levels of learners using a bottom up hierarchy. METHODS: Chief residents trialed several modifications of our traditional morning report to meet these objectives. RESULTS: Several morning report approaches were developed. In our primary morning report, students, residents and faculty split into small groups. The chief resident begins by presenting the case one-liner followed by small group discussion of aspects of the case. The junior-most table member is responsible for sharing the groups ideas with the larger audience. For example, the chief may ask groups to discuss key questions to be considered about the patient's history. The groups discuss the topic, with junior team members offering their input first, facilitated by senior residents with faculty guidance. In similar fashion, the groups may then discuss the physical exam, differential diagnosis or management, depending on educational objectives. The chief and faculty conclude with teaching points. Every other week, the night float residents guide the discussion of a fresh case. We have also created senior-only and internonly morning reports with cases and teaching points presented by the residents. A chief resident and 1 or 2 faculty members facilitate. CONCLUSION: We have created a morning report that encourages active participation and collaboration among all levels of learners, and promotes the development of the learners' clinical reasoning skills while benefiting from faculty expertise.","L619744101     2017-12-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

L. and Davidson, M. and Melgar, T. and Patel, D. and Cucos, D.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the general status of sports medicine training in internal medicine residency programmes in the United States. METHODS: A cross sectional survey of the programme directors and chief residents of each of the 407 accredited internal medicine programmes listed in the 1999-2000 Graduate Medical Education Directory. RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 231 of 404 (57%) programme directors and 233 of 404 (58%) chief residents. A chief and director of the same programme (paired responses) replied from 144 of 404 (36%) programmes surveyed. A formal sports medicine curriculum was reported by 22.1% of programme directors. Programmes with a formal curriculum were 2.9 times more likely to offer any of the sports medicine educational experiences (p<0.0001; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel). Programmes with block rotations were more likely to include all of the educational experiences surveyed than those without (p<0.002 for each; chi(2) test). A total of 162 programmes included sports medicine as part of other rotations. Most programmes only included sports medicine as part of other rotations: 44.6% (103/231) of all programmes and 63.6% (103/162) of programmes with sports medicine as part of other rotations. Some 29.9% (69/231) of directors reported having an elective, and 3.9% (9/231) reported a required rotation. Almost a quarter (21.7%; 50/231) of directors reported that their residents received no clinical experience in sports medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Little attention is given to the subject of sports medicine when internal medicine residency curricula are developed in the United States. Thus only a small percentage of American internal medicine residency programmes provide significant training in sports medicine.","Sweeney, C L     Davidson, M     Melgar, T     Patel, D     Cucos, D     Journal Article     England     Br J Sports Med. 2003 Jun;37(3):219-25.

The impact of this evolution on the rhinologic experience in otolaryngology residency programs is not currently understood. METHODS: An anonymous, web-based survey of chief residents in otolaryngology residency programs was performed. Participants were asked to rate their residency experience in rhinology in terms of didactics, research opportunities, mentorship availability, clinical care, and surgical experience on an ordinal 5-point Likert scale with higher scores representing more favorable responses. RESULTS: Forty-eight respondents completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 17.6%. The overall experience in rhinology was reported as positive (4.3 points). The individual items with statistically lower scores included availability of basic science research (P = .04), comfort level with the medical management of unusual rhinologic issues (P = .0006), and comfort level with advanced sinus procedures (P < .0001). However, overall ratings were high, and even the poorer-scoring items were still rated favorably. In programs with rhinology fellowships, basic science opportunities were reported as being higher (P = .04) than programs without fellowships. There were no other statistically significant differences in programs with rhinology fellowships. There was no correlation between responses and future career choice.

A total of 50 patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis underwent MSPO between 2002 and 2005. The minimum follow-up period was five years. Patient's walking distance ability was 85.4 m (5-180 m) preoperatively and 2,560 m (1500-8000 m) at the last follow-up. Leg pain improved in 100% of the patients and back pain improved in 89% at the last follow-up. The overall results were good to excellent in 90% of the patients, fair in 16% and all patients were satisfied with the outcome at the last follow-up. The osteotomised spinous process eventually united with the retained laminar bridge in all patients within nine months after surgery. Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis can be adequately decompressed with less violation of the integrity of the posterior elements using MSPO.

"",Making epic your friend: A curricular innovation to improve the EMR experience in the clinic,2018,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,33,2,725-726,"Tan, G. S. and Rogers, R. and Stark, R.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622330009,English,,,"Needs and Objectives: EMRs are often cited as a source of burnout for practicing clinicians due to documentation burden, complex interfaces that do not match clinical workflow, and interference with face-to-face time and communication with patients. The goals of this curriculum include optimizing primary care residents' EMR use as a means of 1) promoting patient-centered care within a team-based medical home, 2) creating sustainable practice habits among our future primary care workforce, and 3) mitigating burnout among residents. Setting and Participants: The curriculum is folded into the ambulatory blocks of the IM residents over 3 years, and will be based on the Epic EMR system. The curriculum was started in spring 2017 with a pilot program for interns, and has undergone a slow rollout since. Program leadership is supportive of this longitudinal curriculum, and the faculty in charge is a former chief resident of the program. Description: The curriculum involves a series of brief, targeted sessions over the course of the IM residency, a format chosen to complement the steep learning curve of a resident PCP practice and the competing priorities for residents. There will be regularly scheduled Epic office hours and two didactic sessions for each ambulatory resident cohort. The intention of the office hours and didactics is to provide residents with a consistent forum to seek help with issues such as clinic efficiency, Epic inbasket management, and population management. Starting July 2018, in addition to ongoing office hours and didactics, Dr. Tan will join IT trainers as the clinician lead during intern Epic orientation training, and there will be an added focus on EMR competencies to the existing direct observations of residents in clinic. Evaluation: Evaluation will consist mainly of two parts: needs assessment of residents and ongoing feedback. Firstly, anonymous resident surveys to collect self-identified EMR-related deficiencies and feedback on current sessions. Second, periodic reviews of Epic generated provider efficiency reports to track general areas of need. Third, tracking the questions/topics that residents bring to office hours to inform future curricular planning. Furthermore, future direct observations in the clinic will be supplemented with an evaluation tool for the faculty around EMR use. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED:Overall reception has been positive based on anecdotal feedback and reflections from the 2017 spring pilot intern didactics and office hours sessions. Interns and residents have voiced appreciation of having dedicated curricular time and a go-to resource for Epic-related questions. Given that the pilot curriculum was targeted towards end-of-year interns, they felt that it would have been helpful to have more opportunities to ask questions and to introduce some of this teaching earlier in the year, which inspired the idea of ongoing office hours. Direct observations in the clinic (5 of 8 interns opted in for this option in the spring pilot program) were valuable in both identifying areas of strength and weaknesses.","L622330009     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"

A focus group of UW residents highlighted interest in a dedicated one-month elective available to all residents. By the end of the elective, participants will be able to:-Implement the basics of curriculum development including designing clear goals and objectives and using feedback and evaluation for iterative improvement-Demonstrate the ability to teach in various settings, including, but not limited to: Large group settings, small group settings, bedside teaching, precepting in clinic-Effectively utilize different teaching modalities, including, but not limited to: PowerPoint, chalk talks, handouts, one-on-one teaching-Demonstrate the ability to teach to different levels of learners, including MS3, MS4, R1, R2, and R3-Give effective feedback to learners Setting and Participants: This elective takes place at the UW Medical Center and affiliated hospitals. There are two senior level residents on the elective at a time. Description: This course is a one-month clinical elective for senior residents to learn the basics of curriculum development and to improve their skills as teachers. Residents teach in a variety of educational settings and utilize multiple teaching methods to expand their repertoire. Participants' activities include assigned readings, reflection, structured observation of master educators, and giving and receiving feedback. Alongside Chief Residents and experienced faculty, participants teach learners in clinic, in small and large groups, and on physical diagnosis rounds. Evaluation: Participants' performance in giving feedback and implementing the One Minute Preceptor technique is evaluated through objective structured teaching exercises (OSTEs). Pre and post elective evalu-ation forms are analyzed for participants' confidence in their ability to give effective feedback, give an effective chalk talk, precept in an outpatient clinical setting, teach at the bedside, develop a new teaching session/curriculum, and speak publically. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: A unique aspect of this elective is the varied educational methods and clinical settings in which participants practice and receive feedback on their teaching. The diversity within the elective prepares participants for various teaching opportunities that may arise in their careers. Early feedback revealed that this elective benefitted more than just the participating residents. Medical students, chief residents, and attending physicians described the teaching residents as an asset to the broader UW mission of improving patient care through innovation and education. This elective is sustainable within our program as the basic didactic material, scheduling, and venues necessary for this elective have been identified and coordinated.","L622329639     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"

The secondary objective was to evaluate the current IUD experience of obstetrics and gynecology residents. METHODS: A Web-based survey about IUD knowledge and practices was sent to US obstetrics and gynecology residents in January 2010. An analysis of responses by postgraduate year was completed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We received 699 surveys (36%) from a pool of 1922 residents in 96 different residency programs. A total of 654 respondents (94%) had placed an IUD during residency and 88% had received formal teaching about IUDs during residency. Only 53% of respondents knew that the copper IUD could be used for emergency contraception. Less than 65% of respondents would routinely recommend the IUD to adolescents or immediately after first trimester abortion. CONCLUSIONS: Many US obstetrics and gynecology residents lack knowledge about IUD benefits and do not counsel all eligible women to use IUDs.

"",Who are you gonna call? A study of how residents manage uncertainty when caring for clinic patients,2014,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,29,,S257,"Tanksley, A. L. and Oyler, J. and Ratner, S. and Venable, L. R. and Arora, V.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71495269,English,,,"BACKGROUND: One third of Internal Medicine training occurs in the ambulatory setting, yet evidence suggests we are not adequately preparing trainees for outpatient practice. With the changing healthcare system there is a growing need for assessment of outpatient education, and a substantial interest in improving the quality of this training. While the literature to date has highlighted effective strategies for attending supervision in the inpatient setting, few have evaluated the ambulatory setting. The aim of this study is to describe resident satisfaction with clinic supervision and management of uncertainty with clinic issues. METHODS: From 2010 to 2013, Internal Medicine residents at an academic center completed an end-of-year survey on satisfaction with supervision during their continuity clinic experience and how they dealt with uncertain clinical situations. Trainees were asked to rate overall satisfaction with availability, continuity, amount of supervision during and outside of clinic for the faculty preceptor. They were also asked to select the strategies they use to manage uncertainty when faced with a clinical issue for their patients outside of clinic hours. They were asked to report on a 5-point likert scale how frequently they contacted the attending, asked a resident they knew, read about the topic, asked the on service resident, waited until next visit, asked chief resident or other. Trainees were divided by postgraduate year into two groups consisting of interns and upper level residents. T-tests were used to evaluate associations between postgraduate year and frequency of strategy for management of uncertainty. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2013 categorical and med-peds residents were required to complete an end of year survey, response rate was 90 % (n=343). While 78 % of residents were satisfied with availability of their clinic preceptor outside clinic, only half (56 %) were satisfied with continuity of clinic preceptor. In addition, while 90 % were satisfied with amount of supervision during clinic, only 63 % were satisfied with amount of supervision outside clinic. When trainees were asked how they managed uncertainty for clinic issues outside of clinic, 84 % reported reading about the topic, 42 % asked a resident they know, 26 % asked the on service resident, 22 % contacted the preceptor, 14 % waited until the next visit to address the clinical issue. When comparing upper residents to interns, residents were more likely to report contacting the faculty preceptor (PGY1 mean=2.48, PGY2+ mean=2.81 p=0.018) while interns were more likely to ask the on-service resident (PGY1 mean=3.36, PGY2+ mean=2.45 p=0.0001). Residents commented, The preceptors are all fantastic-more continuity would probably be helpful. CONCLUSIONS: When residents are faced with a clinic patient issue outside of clinic hours for which they are uncertain, they utilize the hierarchy of assistance by consulting the literature and asking colleagues before contacting the attending. Interestingly, upper level residents reported contacting the faculty preceptor for uncertainty more than interns, and interns contacting on-service residents more frequently than upper level residents. This could reflect in part a reluctance of interns to contact the attending or a greater familiarity and comfort with advanced residents for contacting the attending. Regardless, previous studies have described the implication of this step up approach in the inpatient setting and how it can lead to delay of care and patient harm. Further studies are needed to define when clinic attending supervision is warranted, and the most effective ways to improve continuity of the preceptor.","L71495269     2014-06-17 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"
"",Can the utilization of video technology during wound rounds decrease infection rates in a burn unit?,2016,1,1,Journal of Burn Care and Research,,37,,S262,"Taylor, S. and Krzak, A. and Stoll, D. and Wang, S.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L72281807,English,,,"Introduction: Multidisciplinary rounds are paramount in caring for the burn patient. Education is also essential in a large teaching institution. One disadvantage to this concept is the amount of people that enter the patient room during rounds to visualize the wound. There is an increased risk of infection directly proportional to increased exposure when wounds are open. Infections in the burn patient can be detrimental in the acute period, and can cause significant complications if not controlled. A burn is unique in that it provides care for patients with inhalation injuries and large skin defects as a result of burn injuries. These clinical conditions can lead to infectious complications. Visualization of wounds is vital to multidisciplinary care of the burn wound. To achieve this outcome, wound rounds are conducted Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to view the patient's wounds as a multidisciplinary team. Utilizing video technology, wounds may be broadcast to members of the multidisciplinary team without the need for entering the patient's room. Use of this technology allows the team to view the patient's wound in real-time. Methods: With the use of video conferencing technology, a protocol was developed to define the essential participants that would go into the patient room. The wounds are visualized by the attending physician; wound care nurse, chief resident, patient bedside nurse, videographer, and one medical team member. The wound assessment is broadcast to remaining team members outside the patient's room to one of three screens throughout the unit. After each patient assessment, there is a brief discussion to describe the wound and/or progression of wound healing, allow for multidisciplinary discussion, and formulate a plan for ongoing wound care. Results: Data collection is ongoing; however, since we have reinforced and standardized the process for video technology (Wound Rounds Time Out - July 1, 2015) during wound rounds, there is a measured reduction in unit acquired infections (MRSA, VRE). Conclusions: Prior to the use of video technology multiple care providers, as many as 15+, would routinely enter the patient room during wound rounds. Infection control practices were difficult to maintain with a group of this size. Limiting team members entering the room decreases the risk of nosocomial infections. Applicability of Research to Practice: Utilizing this video technology, multidisciplinary wound care is achieved while preventing the transmission of potentially lethal hospital acquired infections.","L72281807     2016-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

OBJECTIVE: To describe the current national landscape of curricula on high-value, cost-conscious medicine (HVCCM) in pediatric residencies, identify the potential factors that may interfere with a pediatric residents ability to perform HVCCM, and determine which educational modalities would be preferred as a means to teach pediatric residents to perform HVCCM. METHODS: IRB-exempt, anonymous, web based survey of pediatric chief residents and pediatric program directors at all pediatric residency programs, with one response per role per program (n=199 programs). RESULTS: We received responses from pediatric chief residents (CR) at 72/199 (36%) programs in 32 different states and pediatric program directors (PD) at 83/199 (42%) programs in 35 states. 12% of CR and 10% of PD reported to have a formal curriculum on HVCCM. Program directors perceived that a lack of cost transparency as the biggest barrier to residents performance of HVCCM, whereas chief residents identified attendings having a final say in treatment decisions. A majority of respondents (83%) agree that their program needs such a curriculum and 89% PD and 92% of CR stated that they would use a curriculum if it were available. Both CR and PD preferred a curriculum with cased based discussion in a morning report or noon conference setting (82% and 79%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The majority of pediatric residency programs responding to this survey do not have a formal curriculum on HVCCM. There is a strong need and desire nationally for HVCCM curriculum in pediatrics, particularly in a case-based discussion format.","L619752315     2017-12-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

G. and Chin, E.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: The management of hyperparathyroidism has evolved rapidly in the past decade with the introduction of intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing, radioguided surgery, and endoscopic surgery. Not surprisingly, there is a corresponding movement toward specialization of surgeons providing increasingly sophisticated treatments for head and neck endocrine disorders. We sought to identify trends in the disciplines performing parathyroid surgery. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, controlled comparison of surgical caseloads and publication volumes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two metrics designed to reflect the proportion of parathyroidectomies being performed by otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons (OHNS) and general surgeons (GS) were chosen: the operative case logs of graduates from American training programs in OHNS and GS from 1996 through 2005 and the number of scientific papers published relating to parathyroid surgery during two timeframes (1991-1995 and 2001-2005). RESULTS: There was a gradual increase in the mean number of parathyroid surgeries performed by GS residents from 6.0 in 1996 to a peak of 9.2 in 2004; this volume has begun to decline (to 8.5 in 2005). During the same timeframe, the mean number of parathyroidectomies performed by OHNS residents rose sharply and steadily from 1.8 in 1996 to 10.9 in 2005. The number of American GS parathyroid publications from 1991 to 1995 was 41, compared with 108 in the period 2001 to 2005. During the same timeframe, the number of American OHNS parathyroid papers increased from 1 to 27. The relative proportion of parathyroid publications authored by American otolaryngologists rose from 2.4% to 20.0% (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Increasingly, otolaryngologists are the primary surgeons in parathyroid operations as indicated by two surrogate metrics. Graduating chief residents in otolaryngology now perform more parathyroid procedures than chief residents in general surgery, and a growing proportion of parathyroid publications are being authored by otolaryngologists.","Terris, David J     Chen, Nan     Seybt, Melanie W     Gourin, Christine G     Chin, Edward     Journal Article     United States     Laryngoscope. 2007 Jun;117(6):1009-12. doi: 10.1097/MLG.0b013e3180485716.

G. and Chin, E.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: The practice of thyroidectomy has evolved over the past 10 years with the introduction of minimally invasive surgery, laryngeal nerve monitoring, and outpatient surgery. We sought to investigate corresponding trends in the disciplines performing thyroid surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The authors conducted a nonrandomized, case-controlled comparison of surgical volumes and systematic analysis of publication volumes. Two surrogates for the proportion of thyroidectomies being performed by otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons (OHNS) and general surgeons (GS) were chosen: 1) the operative case logs of graduates from American training programs in OHNS and GS from 1995 through 2004 were compared; and 2) the number of scientific articles published relating to thyroid surgery were systematically queried for two timeframes (1990-1994 and 2000-2004). RESULTS: There was a gradual increase in the mean number of thyroidectomies performed by GS residents from 13.2 in 1995 to 18.2 in 2004. During the same timeframe, the mean number of thyroidectomies performed by OHNS residents more than doubled from 15.0 to 33.5. The number of American GS thyroid publications from 1990 to 1994 was 79, compared with 98 in the period 2000 to 2004, representing a 24% increase. During the same timeframe, the number of American OHNS articles increased from 14 to 49 (a 250% increase). The relative proportion of thyroid publications authored by American otolaryngologists more than doubled from 15.1% to 33.3% (P = .0017). CONCLUSIONS: A clear trend is emerging in the pattern of thyroid surgery in that a growing proportion of publications are being authored by otolaryngologists compared with general surgeons, and the average number of procedures performed by graduating chief residents is now 84% higher in otolaryngology compared with general surgery.","Terris, David J     Seybt, Melanie W     Siupsinskiene, Nora     Gourin, Christine G     Chin, Edward     Journal Article     United States     Laryngoscope. 2006 Jun;116(6):911-5. doi: 10.1097/01.mlg.0000214855.34706.34.

A. and Marghoob, A. A. and Halpern, A. C.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Total body photography (TBP) and dermatoscopy are imaging techniques used to treat patients with pigmented lesions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe use, training, logistics, and beliefs about these tools among residency programs and to assess changes during a 10-year period. METHODS: Surveys were sent to all directors (n = 111) and chief residents (n = 109) of US dermatology training programs. RESULTS: A total of 83 (74.8%) attendings answered the questionnaire. In all, 59 (71.1%) reported using TBP, an 11.9% increase (P = .2484) over the past decade. Reasons for using TBP included: reduces patient anxiety (81.4%), helps detect early melanoma (78.0%), and leads to fewer biopsies (66.1%). Logistical (79.2%) and financial (45.8%) constraints were reasons for not using TBP. Seventy respondents (84.3%) reported using dermatoscopy, a 40.0% increase (P = .0001) over the 10-year period. Reasons for dermatoscopy use were consistent over time: helps find melanoma in curable stage (75.7%), reduces patient anxiety (61.4%), and leads to fewer biopsies (57.1%). The most common reason for not using dermatoscopy remained lack of training (38.5%). A total of 92 (84.4%) residents completed their survey, of which 41 (44.6%) and 81 (88.0%) reported using TBP and dermatoscopy, respectively. In all, 62 (67.4%) and 79 (85.9%) respondents would prefer additional training in TBP and dermatoscopy, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Results may not be applicable to the general dermatology community. CONCLUSIONS: Use of dermatoscopy among residency programs has increased significantly during the last decade. A more modest increase in the use of TBP was observed. Barriers to diffusion of these technologies into practice persist, including insufficient logistics and training.","1097-6787     Terushkin, Vitaly     Oliveria, Susan A     Marghoob, Ashfaq A     Halpern, Allan C     Journal Article     United States     J Am Acad Dermatol. 2010 May;62(5):794-803. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2009.09.008.

An online survey was sent electronically to radiology residency program directors and chief residents via the Association of University Radiologists. Forty-two radiology program directors and 25 chief residents completed the survey, yielding response rates of 24.9 and 8.5 %, respectively. From the survey results, 10 different Picture Archiving Communications Systems (PACS) were identified; GE (25 %), Philips (17 %), and Agfa Impax (15 %) were the most prevalent. Interestingly, only 5 % of all respondents use a secondary ""Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine"" viewer for on-call studies. Perceptions of PACS functionality were generally neutral to weakly positive. Most respondents strongly agreed that it is important to have a single integrated PACS for viewing on-call studies and agreed that the PACS should be integrated into the Electronic Medical Records (EMR). The overwhelming majority of respondents use their institution's PACS while on-call. The results show there is still a wide variety of PACS platforms used by different institutions; however, GE, Phillips, and Agfa were some of the most prevalent. Most radiologists surveyed have neutral to slightly positive perceptions about the functionality and ease of use of their PACS. Finally, while radiologists agree that PACS should be integrated with EMR, only 53 % of respondents currently have this arrangement.","1618-727x     Tesoriero, Joseph A     Eddy, Paul     Hasso, Anton N     Journal Article     United States     J Digit Imaging. 2015 Apr;28(2):205-12. doi: 10.1007/s10278-014-9741-9.

C.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: To evaluate educational experiences of internal medicine interns before and after maximum shift lengths were decreased from 30 hours to 16 hours. METHOD: The authors compared educational experiences of internal medicine interns at Vanderbilt University Medical Center before (2010; 47 interns) and after (2011; 50 interns) duty hours restrictions were implemented in July 2011. The authors compared number of inpatient encounters, breadth of concepts in notes, exposure to five common presenting problems, procedural experience, and attendance at teaching conferences. RESULTS: Following the duty hours restrictions, interns cared for more unique patients (mean 118 versus 140 patients per intern, P = .005) and wrote more history and physicals (mean 73 versus 88, P = .005). Documentation included more total concepts after the 16-hour maximum shift implementation, with a 14% increase for history and physicals (338 versus 387, P < .001) and a 10% increase for progress notes (316 versus 349, P < .001). There was no difference in the median number of selected procedures performed (6 versus 6, P = 0.94). Attendance was higher at the weekly chief resident conference (60% versus 68% of expected attendees, P < .001) but unchanged at morning report conferences (79% versus 78%, P = .49). CONCLUSIONS: Intern clinical exposure did not decrease after implementation of the 16-hour shift length restriction. In fact, interns saw more patients, produced more detailed notes, and attended more conferences following duty hours restrictions.","1938-808x     Theobald, Cecelia N     Stover, Daniel G     Choma, Neesha N     Hathaway, Jacob     Green, Jennifer K     Peterson, Neeraja B     Sponsler, Kelly C     Vasilevskis, Eduard E     Kripalani, Sunil     Sergent, John     Brown, Nancy J     Denny, Joshua C     K23 AG040157/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     K23AG040157/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Acad Med. 2013 Apr;88(4):512-8. doi: 10.1097/ACM.0b013e318285800f.

D. and Chavez, M. and Brisson, T. E.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the perioperative safety and outcomes of the first 100 robotic-assisted radical prostatectomies (RARPs) performed by a resident trained surgeon entering directly into practice. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Following a mentorship-based urology residency training program, the perioperative safety and outcomes of 100 consecutive RARPs were analyzed. Intraoperative complications, surgical pathology results, hospital course, and catheter removal times were all monitored. Urinary catheter time was considered prolonged if left in place for longer than 14 days. Surgical complications were scored using the Clavien grading system. RESULTS: The resident performed portions of 51 RARPs during the training program in resident years 2-5, including 17 as a chief resident under the guidance of a fellowship-trained robotic surgeon. One hundred RARPs were performed following residency training over a 17-month period (mean age, 60 years; mean body mass index, 29 kg/m(2)). Positive margin rate was 21%, and blood transfusion rate was 5%. Clavien grade 1-4 complication rates were 5%, 9%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. There was one intraoperative rectal injury and one conversion to an open operation. Five percent of patients required a urinary catheter longer than 14 days secondary to anastomotic leakage. There were no re-admissions or re-operations in the series. CONCLUSIONS: The current study serves as a benchmark for physicians entering practice directly from resident training. Mentorship-based residency programs and early console experience may be factors in contributing to perioperative safety and outcomes with newly trained physicians.","1557-9034     Thiel, David D     Chavez, Melissa     Brisson, Theodore E     Journal Article     United States     J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A. 2013 Jun;23(6):516-20. doi: 10.1089/lap.2012.0503.

Our objective was to create an educational plan to address: superfluously subspecialized content, excessive zebra cases, limited time for case discussion, and low morale due to stern learning environment. Setting and Participants: Setting: Baystate Medical Center, a-770-bed tertiary care center. Participants: Approximatley 90 Internal Medicine and Medicine-Pediatrics residents Description: Using perspectives in teaching generation y, our curriculum focused on mentorship; the promotion of a safe learning environment; and interactive teaching through technology. These themes are structured into four parts. I. The first 30 minutes is a resident-led, pre-selected case discussion. Presentations are assigned to residents on elective rotations to provide time for mentorship. Using dual process thinking, chief residents coach residents to create well-defined teaching objectives, while encouraging the incorporation of evidence-based literature. II. The second 30 minutes is a chief-resident-led interactive didactic session using smart board technology to consolidate teaching objectives through resident-requested themes: pathophysiology, board review, and diagnostic skills based exercises. III. Resident feedback based on content and delivery is provided and longitudinally tracked to accommodate individualized learning plans. Residents set goals to improve their next presentation. IV. To promote use of illness scripts, a case summary of the morning report session is composed. Case summaries are centrally digitalized for easy access and include a brief case review, salient teaching points, and didactics review. Mid week sessions incorporate other educational activities, such as: an acid-base curriculum, medical updates, board review, and subspecialty lectures. Evaluation: Cases are tracked with the intent to parallel the ABIM blueprint. A preliminary resident survey resulted primarily positive feedback. Triennial evaluation will be pursued. Future goals are to evaluate trends between morning report attendance and ITE scores. Outcomes:-Increase in attendance in morning report.-Use of learned content by residents and academic attendings in clinical practice.-Morning report cases have been submitted to various medical conferences, some of which have won awards.-Resident evaluations that provide insights commenting on longitudinal individualized learner growth. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: The key to resident engagement is being engaged ourselves as educators. Residents appreciate mentorship. Allowing the learner to become the teacher is empowering and boosts morale. A welcoming learning environment comes from co-resident teaching and support. Involvement of residents in defining educational needs directs content, adding value, which ultimately promotes increased resident engagement. Understanding our millennial learners have been critical in findings these insights and allowing for interactive learning.","L622329857     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

L.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate objectively the colposcopic skills of resident physicians in an obstetrics and gynecology training program. METHODS: One hundred and ten colposcopic examinations were performed in a nonstructured fashion by 16 resident physicians supervised by the full-time gynecology faculty. Data were collected prospectively and were classified according to the resident's ability at colposcopic grading of cervical lesions (accuracy) and their ability to recognize the presence or absence of dysplasia (sensitivity and specificity, respectively) when compared to the corresponding histological interpretations. In addition, results between three groups were compared-junior residents (PGY1 and PGY2), senior residents (PGY3), and chief residents (PGY4)-to analyze learning progression. RESULTS: The numbers of evaluations performed by junior, senior, and chief residents were 43, 33, and 34, respectively. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the residents' colposcopic assessments were 31.8%, 96.7%, and 22%, respectively. There was no difference in any of these measures between the groups analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Residents correctly identified cervical dysplasia in the majority of cases but had difficulty in distinguishing between low-grade and high-grade cervical dysplasia and in differentiating dysplasia from benign cellular changes, such as metaplasia and inflammation. Colposcopic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity did not seem to improve with increasing experience. Resident colposcopic skills may improve if more structured training is implemented, particularly if emphasis is placed on teaching differences between benign cellular changes and dysplastic lesions.","Toglia, M R     Coburn, K M     Pearl, M L     Journal Article     United States     J Low Genit Tract Dis. 1997 Jan;1(1):5-8.

However, aside from the role of medical expert, it is somewhat difficult to formally assess the other CanMEDS roles. Methods: Chief residents (n=36) were evaluated with two surveys at the time of a weekend course. The response rate was 100%. Both surveys were validated on 5000 business students. One survey evaluates the personal management skills with 84 questions scored on a Likert scale, and the other evaluates the residents' communication skills with 20 questions scored on a Likert scale, as well as some case scenarios evaluating their communication style. The same surveys were administered through email to the residents' program directors (PDs) in a blinded fashion to see if PDs agreed with the residents' self- assessment. The response rate for PDs was 50% Results: Graduating urology residents tend to score slightly higher (mean score 93.2) on communication skills compared to business students (mean score 90.91). They do, however, score lower on management skills (mean score 385.3 for urology residents vs. 394.55 for business students). There was no difference in the residents' self-assessment of their own communication and management skills and the evaluation of PDs of the their residents' skills. Conclusions: This objective way of evaluating the Leader and Communicator CanMEDS roles reveals that graduating urology residents score better than business students in communication, but lower in management skills. It would appear that the residents' self-assessments do not differ much from their PDs' evaluation.","L623020496     2018-07-18 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"
22362434,Patient suicides in psychiatric residencies and post-vention responses: a national survey of psychiatry chief residents and program directors,2012,1,1,Acad Psychiatry,1042-9670 (Print) 1042-9670,36,1,34-8,"Tsai, A. and Moran, S. and Shoemaker, R. and Bradley, J.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: This report focuses on post-vention measures taken by U.S. psychiatry residencies when a resident-in-training experiences a patient suicide. METHODS: A survey distributed to program directors and chief residents obtained an estimate of the frequency of psychiatric residents' experiencing a patient suicide and the frequency of numerous post-vention activities utilized by psychiatric residencies in 2008. The survey looked at the presence or absence of a post-vention protocol within a program and determined whether there was an effect on the number of patient suicides and the frequency of post-vention activities within a program. The data were compared with the results of a similar survey from 1994 to determine whether there had been significant progress in the practice of supportive post-vention activities within training institutions. RESULTS: There was a 21% response rate from chief residents (N=54) and a 31.1% response rate from program directors (N=94). Chief residents reported 1.44 suicides per residency, and program directors reported 0.88 suicides per residency for the 2008 calendar year. This corresponded to approximately 1 in 20 residents' experiencing a patient suicide in the 12-month period. Both groups reported approximately 1 in 5 psychiatry residency programs with written post-vention protocols, which was unchanged from the 1994 survey. When a protocol was in place, chief residents reported a statistically significant increase in timely notification of the program director, process groups, therapy or counseling, and emergency leave, whereas program directors reported a statistically significant decrease in post-vention therapy or counseling. Further statistical analysis revealed a tendency for programs with post-vention protocols to have more reported suicides. CONCLUSIONS: Post-vention protocols may be developed by residencies as a need to address residents experiencing a patient suicide. Discrepancies in the reports of chief residents and program directors in post-vention activities may reflect a lack of consensus on post-vention training and education within psychiatric residencies.","1545-7230     Tsai, Al     Moran, Scott     Shoemaker, Richard     Bradley, John     Journal Article     United States     Acad Psychiatry. 2012 Jan 1;36(1):34-8. doi: 10.1176/appi.ap.09100186.

In 64 orthopaedic residents, four predictors (United States Medical Licensing Examination [USMLE] Part I scores, Alpha Omega Alpha status, junior year clinical clerkship honors grades, and the QCST score) were analyzed with respect to four residency outcomes assessments. The outcomes included three standardized assessments, the orthopaedic in-training examination scores (OITE), the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) written and oral examinations, and an internal outcomes assessment, attainment of satisfactory chief resident associate (CRA) status. Collectively, the QCST score had the strongest association as a predictor for all three standardized outcomes assessments (p < 0.001). Honors grades during junior years clinical clerkships was most strongly associated with satisfactory CRA status (p < 0.001).

Although the availability of simulators and skills laboratories has expanded, little is known about their use and effect on residency training. METHODS: An online survey consisting of 18 questions was distributed to all members of the Association of Program Directors in Surgery. The survey addressed surgical skills laboratory funding, types of simulators, curricula, tools for evaluation, and opinions on successful implementation of a skills laboratory. Statistical analysis was performed on data obtained from completed surveys. RESULTS: A total of 248 programs were invited to respond to the survey, and 81 responses were obtained (33% response rate). Among programs that responded, most mandate time for residents to use their skills laboratory (76%), and most offer a formal curriculum (63%). Few programs require demonstrated proficiency before participating in the operating room (16%), and only 55% of responders believed that their resident's overall intraoperative technical skills had improved since the implementation of their skills laboratory. Respondents believed that interns derive the most benefit from their skills laboratory when compared with all other years of surgical training (P < 0.001). Faculty participation was most commonly considered as the most important factor for successful implementation of a surgical skills laboratory, regardless of program characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Among surgical residency programs that responded to the survey, most programs schedule time for residents to use a skills laboratory, and most use a curriculum. Those surveyed report that interns derive the most benefit, whereas chief residents derive the least.

R.",,eng,,,"PURPOSE: To determine whether PGY-1 future fellowship preferences are stable during progression through residency. METHODS: Residents who took the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) were surveyed about fellowships. Three data files were created: categorical and nondesignated preliminary trainees at all postgraduate years (PGY); categorical PGY-1 and chief residents; and individual categorical residents with paired PGY-1 and PGY-5 responses. Gender was self-reported; residency characteristics were retrieved via program identifier codes. Annual frequency distributions were generated by specialty and for other, any fellowship (AF), and no fellowship (NF). RESULTS: Categorical plus contains more than 80,000 responses. Undecided leads PGY-1 intentions at all times, which reached 55% by 2007 and decreased near linearly as PGY level advances. The AF rates increase by PGY level in a decelerating curve. The other rates accelerate at PGY-3 and beyond. The NF rates are low for PGY-1 and 2, nearly double from PGY-3 to 4, and double again from PGY-4 to 5. The categorical group contains more than 20,000 residents with their demographics. The undecided group predominates for both genders, but more women were undecided by 2003. Specialty distribution varies with gender; women were overrepresented in oncology, pediatric, plastic, and other. The undecided group leads choices of university and independent PGY-1 residents, with university overrepresentation in all areas except colorectal, plastic, and no fellowship. Small, medium, and large program PGY-1 residents all choose undecided first but diverge thereafter. Over 12,000 paired categorical PGY-1 and PGY-5 responses reveal that most PGY-1 residents (78%) change future specialties by PGY-5. Undecided residents most often choose no fellowship (25%), vascular (12%), or other (12%). CONCLUSION: PGY-1 residents are increasingly unsure about future fellowships. PGY-1 preferences are unstable whether examined in groups or as individuals. Gender and residency characteristics are linked to differing selection patterns. PGY-1 residents rarely predict accurately their PGY-5 fellowship choices. Early specialization paradigms may disadvantage some residents and residency groups and risk greater attrition rates.","Vick, Laura R     Borman, Karen R     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2008 Nov-Dec;65(6):445-52. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2008.07.003.

C. and Tran, T. C. and Larson, G. M.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: General surgeons commonly perform upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in practice, but few perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), partly because of limited training opportunities. This report focuses on the value of an ERCP fellowship training program to a broad-based, mature residency in surgery and our observations on the experience required for surgeons to be trained in advanced interventional ERCP. METHODS: Since the program was initiated in 1992, 13 ERCP fellows have been trained for individual periods of 6 to 14 months. This study investigated all procedures with fellow involvement (2,008 cases) from among a total experience of 3,641 ERCPs. Data collected included type of ERCP (diagnostic/therapeutic), fellow success in cannulating the duct of interest, and faculty success in cases of fellows who failed. Of the 13 fellows, 9 had previous endoscopy experience, but none had training in ERCP. RESULTS: An 85% cannulation rate was accepted as successful, and cannulation rates for each fellow were calculated for each 3-month period. The 85% mark was reached by 4 (31%) of 13 fellows in the first period, 2 of 13 fellows (15%) in the second period, 5 of 11 fellows (45%) in the third period, 7 of 10 fellows (70%) in the fourth period, and 1 of 1 fellow (100%) in the fifth period of training. On the average, it took 7.1 months and 102 ERCPs for trainees to reach desired success levels. Success came more promptly with prior exposure to endoscopy. Fellows without prior endoscopic experience required 148 cases to reach 85% success. Resident surgical experience with major pancreatic resections increased threefold after establishment of the fellowship. CONCLUSIONS: Training in ERCP is possible within the scope of a surgical fellowship in a reasonable length of time and experience. Complication rates remain low even with fellow involvement.

METHODS: Questionnaires were sent electronically to all doctors working as residents and chief residents in two French speaking hospital networks in Switzerland. Participants completed the questionnaire twice, within a 4-week interval. The discriminant validity was examined in comparing doctors' performance according to their reported EBM previous training. Proportion of agreement between both sessions of the questionnaire, Cohen's kappa and 'uniform kappa' determined its test-retest reliability. RESULTS: The participation rate was 9.8%/7.1% to first/second session. Performance increased according to the level of doctors' previous training in EBM. The observed proportion of agreement between both sessions was over 70% for 14/19 questions, and the 'uniform kappa' was superior to 0.60 for 15/19 questions. CONCLUSION: The discriminant validity and test-retest reliability of the questionnaire were satisfying.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized cross-controlled educational trial on medical students during two clerkship rotations in three departments, assessing the impact of the use of CPOE on their ability to place adequate monitoring and therapeutic orders using a written test before and after each rotation. Students' satisfaction with their practice and the order placement system was surveyed. A multivariate mixed model was used to take individual students and chief resident (CR) effects into account. Factorial analysis was applied on the satisfaction questionnaire to identify dimensions, and scores were compared on these dimensions. RESULTS: Thirty-six students show no better progress (beginning and final test means = 69.87 and 80.98 points out of 176 for the control group, 64.60 and 78.11 for the CPOE group, p = 0.556) during their rotation in either group, even after adjusting for each student and CR, but show a better satisfaction with patient care and greater involvement in the medical team in the CPOE group (p = 0.035*). Both groups have a favorable opinion regarding CPOE as an educational tool, especially because of the order reviewing by the supervisor. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized controlled trial assessing the performance of CPOE in both the progress in prescriptions ability and satisfaction of the students. The absence of effect on the medical skills must be weighted by the small time scale and low sample size. However, students are more satisfied when using CPOE rather than usual training.","1932-6203     Wack, Maxime     Puymirat, Etienne     Ranque, Brigitte     Georgin-Lavialle, Sophie     Pierre, Isabelle     Tanguy, Aurelia     Ackermann, Felix     Mallet, Celine     Pavie, Juliette     Boultache, Hakima     Durieux, Pierre     Avillach, Paul     Journal Article     Randomized Controlled Trial     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     PLoS One. 2015 Sep 14;10(9):e0138094. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0138094. eCollection 2015.

R.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Adequate resident training in aesthetic surgery has become increasingly important with rising demand. Chief resident aesthetic clinics allow hands on experience with an appropriate amount of autonomy. The purpose of this study was to compare resident cosmetic clinic outcomes to those reported in the literature. Furthermore, we sought to assess how effective these clinics can be in preparing residents in performing common aesthetic surgery procedures. METHOD: A retrospective chart review of 326 patients and 714 aesthetic procedures in our chief cosmetic clinic over a 13-year period was performed, and complication and revision rates were recorded. In addition, an electronic survey was sent to 26 prior chief residents regarding their experience and impressions of the chief resident aesthetic clinic. RESULT: A total of 713 procedures were performed on 326 patients. Patient ages ranged from 5 to 75 years old (mean, 40.8 years old) with a mean follow-up of 76.2 days. On average, there were 56 procedures performed per year. Of the 714 total procedures performed, there were 136 minor procedures and 578 major procedures. Of the 136 minor procedures, there were no complications and there was 1 revision of a cosmetic injection. Of the 578 major procedures, the overall complication rate was 6.1% and the revision rate was 12.8%. Complication and revision rates for each individual surgery were further analyzed and compared with the literature. The complication rates for these procedures fell within the reference ranges reported. In regards to the chief resident survey, there was a 77% response rate. All respondents reported that the chief resident clinic positively affected their residency education and future practice. Ninety percent of respondents felt ""very comfortable"" performing facelifts, body contouring, and aesthetic breast surgery. No respondents completed a subsequent cosmetic fellowship, and 60% stated that their positive experience in chief clinic contributed to their decision not to pursue a cosmetic fellowship. CONCLUSIONS: Chief resident clinics can provide results with acceptable complication and revision rates that fall within the acceptable ranges in the literature. In addition, it provides a valuable experience that leaves residents with high comfort levels in performing key procedures in aesthetic surgery.","1536-3708     Walker, Nicholas J     Crantford, John C     Rudolph, Megan A     David, Lisa R     Journal Article     United States     Ann Plast Surg. 2018 Jun;80(6):600-606. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001443.

However, in most training programs in the developing world, this role does not exist. OBJECTIVES: We sought to develop a collaborative program to train the first medical chief residents for the University of Rwanda and to assess the impact of the new chief residency on residency training, using questionnaires and qualitative interviews with Rwandan faculty, chief residents, and residents. METHODS: The educational context and the process leading up to the appointment of Rwandan chief residents, including selection, job description, and necessary training (in the United States and Rwanda), are described. One year after implementation, we used a parallel, mixed methods approach to evaluate the new chief medical resident program through resident surveys as well as semistructured interviews with key informants, including site chief residents, chief residents, and faculty. We also observed chief residents and site chief residents at work and convened focus groups with postgraduate residents to yield additional qualitative information. RESULTS: Rwandan faculty and residents generally felt that the new position had improved the educational and administrative structure of the teaching program while providing a training ground for future academicians.

D.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L619743902,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Assessment of faculty teaching has long relied on normative Likert-type evaluations. After positive experiences with resident milestones, we developed faculty teaching milestones based on the Stanford Faculty Clinical Teaching rubric. We proposed that this tool would provide more variable assessments of faculty teaching performance by pediatric and medicine- pediatric residents. METHODS: NCH Faculty Clinical Teaching Milestones (NCH FCTM) are composed of 10 items (9 based on the Stanford rubric + 1 professionalism item) as created by a committee of program directors (PDs) and faculty development leaders followed by 4 cycles of review and clarification/revision by other PDs, faculty educators, chief residents, and trainees. Final revisions occurred after a pilot trial (25 resident raters). NCH FCTM were collected from Jul-Sep 2015 and contrasted with faculty evaluations performed by similar level residents from Jul-Sep 2014 using a normative system. RESULTS: The NCH FCTM method was well regarded by trainees (domains better identified faculty teaching performance) compared to the previous traditional faculty evaluation model. They found the NCH FCTM method easy to use; faculty perception was also positive. In these early results, the NCH FCTM method did not provide more variability in overall scores of faculty (see Table) but provided lower mean and median values and thus a more complete range to assess higher and lower performance. Analysis of specific inpatient, ICU and EM faculty demonstrated results similar to the all faculty analysis. For the specific Feedback item SD, COVand QCOD were greater while for Professionalism COV was greater than that seen with the 2014 method. CONCLUSIONS: These newly developed Faculty Teaching Milestones provided a better assessment method of faculty teaching performance than a traditional Likert-based normative method. The greater range of milestone determinations and greater dispersion should allow more specific assessments and feedback to help drive improvement in faculty teaching skills.","L619743902     2017-12-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Little is known about what trainees are taught about medical errors. OBJECTIVE: 1) To determine the amount and type of training that pediatric residents have about medical errors and 2) to assess pediatric chief resident knowledge about medical errors. METHODS: We surveyed chief residents from a national sample of 51 pediatric training programs by selecting every fourth program from the American Council on Graduate Medical Education list of accredited programs. The 21-item telephone survey was developed with patient safety specialists and piloted on several chief residents. It asked about patient-safety training sessions and awareness and knowledge about medical errors. RESULTS: The 51 chief residents helped teach 2176 residents, approximately one third of all pediatric residents. One third of programs had no lectures about medical errors and 23% did not have morbidity and mortality rounds. Sixty-one percent of respondents stated that outpatient medical errors were rarely discussed. Informal teaching was most often reported as the primary method for educating residents about medical errors. Although 58% of respondents did not know that a systemic change should be made in response to a medical error, 83% felt that residents are adequately trained to deal with a medical error.

Few published reports demonstrate actual MSF results for a residency class, and fewer still include clinical quality measures and knowledge-based testing performance in the data set. METHODS: Residents participating in a year-long group practice experience called the ""long-block"" received MSF that included self, peer, staff, attending physician, and patient evaluations, as well as concomitant clinical quality data and knowledge-based testing scores. Residents were given a rank for each data point compared with peers in the class, and these data were reviewed with the chief resident and program director over the course of the long-block. RESULTS: Multisource feedback identified residents who performed well on most measures compared with their peers (10%), residents who performed poorly on most measures compared with their peers (10%), and residents who performed well on some measures and poorly on others (80%). Each high-, intermediate-, and low-performing resident had a least one aspect of the MSF that was significantly lower than the other, and this served as the basis of formative feedback during the long-block. CONCLUSION: Use of multi-source feedback in the ambulatory setting can identify high-, intermediate-, and low-performing residents and suggest specific formative feedback for each. More research needs to be done on the effect of such feedback, as well as the relationships between each of the components in the MSF data set.","1949-8357     Warm, Eric J     Schauer, Daniel     Revis, Brian     Boex, James R     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2010 Jun;2(2):269-77. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-09-00102.1.

G. and Stolz, U.",,eng,,,"Musculoskeletal complaints are the most common reason for patients to visit a physician, yet competency in musculoskeletal medicine is invariably reported as a deficiency in medical education in the USA. Sports medicine clinical rotations improve both medical students' and residents' musculoskeletal knowledge. Despite the importance of this knowledge, a standardized sports medicine curriculum in emergency medicine (EM) does not exist. Hence, we developed a novel sports medicine rotation for EM residents to improve their musculoskeletal educational experience and to improve their knowledge in musculoskeletal medicine by teaching the evaluation and management of many common musculoskeletal disorders and injuries that are encountered in the emergency department. The University of Arizona has two distinct EM residency programs, South Campus (SC) and University Campus (UC). The UC curriculum includes a traditional 4-week orthopedic rotation, which consistently rated poorly on evaluations by residents. Therefore, with the initiation of a new EM residency at SC, we replaced the standard orthopedic rotation with a novel sports medicine rotation for EM interns. This rotation includes attendance at sports medicine clinics with primary care and orthopedic sports medicine physicians, involvement in sport event coverage, assigned reading materials, didactic experiences, and an on-call schedule to assist with reductions in the emergency department. We analyzed postrotation surveys completed by residents, postrotation evaluations of the residents completed by primary care sports medicine faculty and orthopedic chief residents, as well as the total number of dislocation reductions performed by each graduating resident at both programs over the last 5 years. While all residents in both programs exceeded the ten dislocation reductions required for graduation, residents on the sports medicine rotation had a statistically significant higher rate of satisfaction of their educational experience when compared to the traditional orthopedics rotation. All SC residents successfully completed their sports medicine rotation, had completed postrotation evaluations by attending physicians, and had no duty hour violations while on sports medicine. In our experience, a sports medicine rotation is an effective alternative to the traditional orthopedics rotation for EM residents.","Waterbrook, Anna L     Pritchard, T Gail     Lane, Allison D     Stoneking, Lisa R     Koch, Bryna     McAtee, Robert     Grall, Kristi H     Min, Alice A     Prior, Jessica     Farrell, Isaac     McNulty, Holly G     Stolz, Uwe     Journal Article     New Zealand     Adv Med Educ Pract. 2016 Apr 21;7:249-55. doi: 10.2147/AMEP.S92428. eCollection 2016.

B.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of resident physicians regarding sepsis in general and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines in particular. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, we surveyed internal medicine (IM) and emergency medicine (EM) house staff from 3 separate institutions. House staff were notified of the survey via e-mail from their residency director or chief resident. The survey was Internet-based (using http://www.surveymonkey.com ), voluntary, and anonymous. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines were used to develop the survey. The survey was open between December 2015 and April 2016. No incentives for participation were given. Reminder e-mails were sent approximately every 3 to 4 weeks to all eligible participants. Comparisons of responses were evaluated using the N-1 2-proportion test. RESULTS: A total of 133 responses were received. These included 84 from IM house staff, 27 from EM house staff, and 22 who selected ""other."" Eighty (101/126) percent reported managing at least 1 patient with sepsis in the preceding 30 days, 85% (97/114) rated their knowledge of the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines as ""very familiar"" or at least ""somewhat familiar,"" and 84% (91/108) believed their training in the diagnosis and management of sepsis was ""excellent"" or at least ""good."" However, 43% (47/108) reported not receiving any feedback on their treatment of patients with sepsis in the last 30 days, while 24% (26/108) received feedback once. Both IM and EM house staff received comparable rates of feedback (62% vs 48%, respectively; P = .21). For the 3 questions that directly tested knowledge of the guidelines, the scores of the IM and EM house staff were similar. Notably, <20% of both groups correctly identified diagnostic criteria for sepsis. CONCLUSION: Additional education of IM and EM house staff on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines is warranted, along with more consistent feedback regarding their diagnosis and management of sepsis.","1525-1489     Watkins, Richard R     Haller, Nairmeen     Wayde, Melinda     Armitage, Keith B     Journal Article     United States     J Intensive Care Med. 2017 Jan 1:885066617737304. doi: 10.1177/0885066617737304.

M. and Carney, M. J. and Yan, C. and Percec, I.",,eng,,,"Background: With the evolving plastic surgery training paradigm, there is an increasing emphasis on aesthetic surgery education during residency. In an effort to improve aesthetic education and to encourage preparation for independent practice, our institution has supported a resident-run aesthetic clinic for over two decades. Objectives: To provide insight into the educational benefits of a resident-run cosmetic clinic through longitudinal resident follow up and institutional experiential review. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted to identify all clinic-based aesthetic operations performed between 2009 and 2016. To capture residents' perspectives on the cosmetic resident clinic, questionnaires were distributed to the cohort. Primary outcome measures included: volume and types of cases performed, impact of clinic experience on training, confidence level performing cosmetic procedures, and satisfaction with chief clinic. Unpaired t tests were calculated to compare case volume/type with level of confidence and degree of preparedness to perform cosmetic procedures independently. Results: Overall, 264 operations performed by 18 graduated chief residents were reviewed. Surveys were distributed to 28 chief residents (71.4% completion rate). Performing twenty or more clinic-based procedures was associated with higher levels of preparedness to perform cosmetic procedures independently (P = 0.037). Residents reported the highest confidence when performing cosmetic breast procedures when compared to face/neck (P = 0.005), body/trunk procedures (P = 0.39), and noninvasive facial procedures (P = 0.85). Conclusions: The continued growth of aesthetic surgery highlights the need for comprehensive training and preparation for the new generation of plastic surgeons. Performing cosmetic procedures in clinic is a valuable adjunct to the traditional educational curriculum and increases preparedness and confidence for independent practice.","1527-330x     Weissler, Jason M     Carney, Martin J     Yan, Chen     Percec, Ivona     Journal Article     England     Aesthet Surg J. 2017 Oct 16;37(10):1188-1198. doi: 10.1093/asj/sjx103.

M.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVES: To examine: 1) the relationship between residents' responses toward caring for underserved children and families during residency and their perceptions of their continuity clinic experience; and 2) which characteristics are related to continuing to care for the underserved after completion of training. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. METHODS: A 49-item questionnaire was mailed to 210 third-year pediatric residents at 12 urban training programs in the Northeast in May 1995. Information was collected about residents' emotional responses toward caring for underserved families, their assessments of clinic operations, their sense of effectiveness in caring for underserved patients in continuity clinic, preresidency experiences with the underserved, and their intent to care for the underserved after training. RESULTS: Of 210 surveys mailed, 71% were returned. Thirty-six percent of residents planned to pursue a career in primary care, 53% did not, and 11% did not answer or were planning a year as chief resident. Fifty-seven percent of all residents planned to devote a portion of their practice toward caring for the underserved after training. Residents whose emotional responses toward caring for the underserved included: 1) not worrying that they had become numb to children's psychosocial difficulties, 2) not feeling angry with how families cared for their children, and 3) feeling more empathy with the underserved had significantly higher mean scores on both their assessment of clinic operations and their sense of effectiveness. The only demographic characteristic associated with a greater sense of effectiveness was being black. To better characterize which residents planned to care for the underserved after training, we examined a subsample of 46 residents who recalled an interest in caring for the underserved during residency training and who were pursuing a career in primary care. Residents that did not recall an interest in caring for the underserved at the onset of residency training were unlikely to have plans to care for the underserved after the completion of training. Within this group residents who planned to care for the underserved after training differed significantly from residents who did not plan to continue this work by feeling a greater sense of effectiveness in clinic, feeling less worried about becoming numb, and having greater empathy for underserved families. CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of identifiable emotional responses residents develop toward caring for the underserved that relate to their perceptions of continuity clinic and whether a resident chooses to continue to care for the underserved after training.","1098-4275     Weitzman, C C     Freudigman, K     Schonfeld, D J     Leventhal, J M     MCJ-00987/PHS HHS/United States     Journal Article     Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

Instead of being the universal word for ""immediate,"" it has become a convenient phrase used, in some cases, to get what the physician wants now. Although the principles of this article may be applied to many modalities in the healthcare field, this article deals solely with portable chest x-rays performed at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview in Minneapolis. The diagnostic radiology department performed a 2-week analysis of orders in August 2004. The results showed that 74% of all portable chest x-rays were ordered as STAT. The manager, along with a staff radiologist, then created a list of clinical reasons that were appropriate for STAT, ASAP, or Routine orders. Then, there was a 2-week period of time delegated for education, during which the list was brought to the nurse managers of several patient care areas as well as some chief residents at the university's medical school. These individuals then shared the list with their staff. A second analysis conducted in November 2004 showed that an 11% decrease had been achieved. Given that 20,000 portable chest x-rays are performed at the medical center annually, the figure represents a 2,200 reduction in STAT portables per year. With the success of this endeavor, the radiology department piloted a second program to further decrease the number of STAT orders. Since the radiology department was using computed radiography (CR) and a picture archiving and communication system (PACS), research began to unearth the response times. The idea was to advertise to physicians how fast they could get their images, using the theory that if the times were quick enough, perhaps there would less of a tendency to order STATs. The results showed that a STAT order could be completed and viewable on PACS in an average of 17 minutes, and an ASAP in 28 minutes. A poster advertising these response times was generated and distributed to the nurse managers and residents to post in the inpatient units. The poster was well received. A two-week survey conducted in March 2005 showed that STATs now accounted for 54% of the portable chest x-rays. With this two-pronged approach, the radiology department was able to decrease the number of portable chest X-rays by 20%.

S. and Fassiotto, M.",,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: As resident burnout increases, there is a need for better awareness, resources, and interventions. Challenges in balancing work and life priorities have been implicated in contributing to physician burnout. Institutional work-life policies (WLPs) are critical tools to meet work-life needs. This study investigates the influence of WLPs on residents' experiences. METHODS: The authors emailed a SurveyMonkey link to the APA chief resident and Minority Fellow listservs and directly to 94 psychiatry program directors and 52 fellowship directors nationwide to distribute a survey to residents regarding WLP use and barriers, as well as burnout. Estimated response rate was 12-23%. The authors assessed the anonymous responses using SPSS to evaluate for relationships between awareness of WLPs, perceptions/barriers surrounding their usage, and burnout. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 255 responses. Awareness and use of policies ranged from 2 to 33%. A prominent barrier to WLPs is that use results in shifting workload to co-residents (48% agree). Respondents who perceived leadership to view use of WLPs as a sign of weakness (16% agree) were less likely to use WLPs (t (89) = -3.52, p < 0.001, d = 0.61). Residents with burnout (41%) perceived vastly higher barriers to using WLPs as compared to those without burnout. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the need for further investigation of WLPs to mitigate resident burnout and identifies important perceived barriers that affect the use of WLPs including low awareness, potential for shifting workload to co-residents, and negative perceptions of leadership attitudes toward WLPs.","1545-7230     Westercamp, Nicole     Wang, Raziya S     Fassiotto, Magali     Journal Article     United States     Acad Psychiatry. 2018 Feb;42(1):73-77. doi: 10.1007/s40596-017-0757-6.

Background: The current didactic schedule for 3rd year medical students on the neurology clerkship includes formal faculty lectures, but informal resident teaching opportunities are often trumped by patient care responsibilities. The goals of resident-led Sign-Out Rounds are to provide an opportunity for informal, low-pressure, student-centered teaching, and to improve student understanding of neurologic disease. Design/Methods: The Neurology Chief Resident at the University of Rochester Medical Center led a half-hour teaching session on weekdays during the first clerkship block of 2014. One day per week the Child Neurology Chief Resident led the session. Topics included overviews of common neurologic chief complaints (e.g. headache). A pre-test survey using a 5point Likert scale was administered to evaluate comfort level in assessing eight of the most common neurologic chief complaints. A similar post-test survey was administered at the end of the rotation, and scores were compared using paired t-tests. Comments were coded for strengths and suggestions for improvement. Results: Sign-Out Rounds were held 16 days over 4 weeks, with 12 medical students in the clerkship block. The pre and post survey response rate was 100[percnt] and 92[percnt], respectively. 100[percnt] of survey responders supported continuation of Sign-Out Rounds. The level of comfort in assessing each chief complaint improved significantly after 4 weeks (p-value ranged from 0.001 to 0.024). Students commented that sessions were organized and informal, but they would have appreciated handouts. Conclusions: Daily Sign-Out Rounds for 3rd year students were associated with improved comfort levels in assessing common neurologic chief complaints.","L71921864     2015-06-29 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

To determine if endoscopic carpal tunnel release can be safely performed by trainees, the outcomes of 84 patients who underwent endoscopic carpal tunnel release performed by a chief resident or hand fellow in a supervised setting were reviewed. All but 1 patient had uneventful procedures and complete resolution of preoperative symptoms. One patient with persistent symptoms represented the only complication. At reexploration through a standard palmar incision, the transverse carpal ligament was found to have been completely divided and fulminant tenosynovitis surrounding the nerve and flexor tendons was presumed to be the cause of his persistent symptoms. It appears that endoscopic carpal tunnel release can be safely performed by chief residents in a supervised clinical setting. Given that this procedure has a high learning curve, repeated exposure during a residency training program may offer significant advantages over the current approach of training surgeons during a single cadaveric instructional course.","Wheatley, M J     Hall, J W     Pratt, D     Faringer, P D     Journal Article     United States     Ann Plast Surg. 1996 Sep;37(3):254-7.

M. and Murray, K. and Smola, C. and Tofil, N.

Despite this, limited formal training is provided in medical school or residency. Communication can be improved by increasing the presence and thoroughness of crosscover notes. Our hypothesis is that a structured simulation exercise could improve documentation proficiency. METHODS: 2.5 hr simulation course provided formal documentation training to new interns. Interns received a simulated checkout of patient lists from chief residents exemplifying proper and improper technique. Interns were called by a bedside confederate nurse to evaluate a simulated patient. The team cared for the patient and each intern composed a cross-cover note. The note was reviewed for 12 items. Feedback was provided and the 12 elements were taught. Interns then cared for a second patient and composed a second note. Feedback was again provided. Cross-cover notes of actual patients transferred to a higher level of care were reviewed for the 12 items before and after the intervention. Chi square and t tests were done utilizing SPSS 11.5. RESULTS: 22 interns participated. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive. On chart review, 42/50 (84%) pre-course charts had a note vs. 23/47 (48%) post course (p <.01). The average items present were the same pre and post (92 vs. 93). Most commonly missed elements for both time periods included assessment (33/65 not present) and temperature and respiratory rate (31/ 65 not present). Most commonly present items included date (65/ 65) and time and signature (62/65). Assessment was more likely to be present post- intervention (p <.01). Laboratory data were more likely to be present pre-intervention (p<.01). DISCUSSION: A simulation course did not improve the presence of cross cover notes on actual patients. It was however well received. Interestingly there was significant improvement in the presence of an assessment component. The study shows which items are most likely missing in a cross cover note. A different educational approach may be more helpful in improving the presence of this documentation.","L71255375     2013-12-17 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

OBJECTIVE: To explore pediatric residents MR experiences, preferences, and perceived learning. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study of pediatric residents at the University of Colorado (2016-2017). MR occurs weekdays 7:30-8:00 AM. We conducted focus groups with a semi-structured interview guide and analyzed transcripts via constant comparative methods according to grounded theory methodology, reaching thematic saturation. We developed codes iteratively, resolved disagreements by consensus, and identified major themes. RESULTS: Twenty-six residents (10 PGY-1, 5 PGY-2, 11 PGY- 3) participated in five focus groups. Most attended MR 2-3 times per week. Analyses revealed four themes: (1) Factors Affecting Attendance: Service obligations impeded on-time attendance and caused frequent interruptions. Fatigue after service months and gap time before elective rotations hindered attendance. (2) Resident Learning & Curriculum Development: Resident learning was hit or miss. Interactive discussions of relevant topics and attending/ fellow input promoted learning. Residents desired a structured curriculum, explicit learning objectives, and varied teaching methods (e.g. chalk talks). (3) Conference Climate & Engagement: Resident engagement was variable. Some residents perceived attending physician's presence as intimidating. Lecture hall style seating, late arrival, and fear of appearing unintelligent inhibited participation. (4) Resident Presenter & Chief Resident Roles and Challenges: Presenters were challenged by case selection and preparation, time management, and engagement of all learner levels. Increased chief resident involvement, beyond transcribing discussions, was desired to mitigate challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Residents perceived MR as valuable when interactive discussions facilitated learning in a safe environment. Work is needed to improve attendance, optimize the learning climate, create a curriculum with novel teaching strategies, and develop resident presenter skills.","L623223964     2018-07-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

"",Diagnostic error education and reporting among physicians in internal medicine training programs,2018,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,33,2,159-160,"Windish, D. and Wijesekera, T. P. and Sanders, L.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L622329622,English,,,"Background: Diagnostic errors occur in 10-15% of patient encounters. Given this number, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a landmark study on ways to decrease diagnostic errors. Using goals of the IOM report, we aimed to determine Internal Medicine physicians' education and training in reporting diagnostic error along with their comfort in reporting. Methods: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional survey targeting residents and faculty in Traditional Internal Medicine, Primary Care Internal Medicine, and Internal Medicine-Pediatrics at nine community and university-based training programs in Connecticut. Questions addressed the IOM's 2nd, 5 and 6th goals by assessing how training programs teach residents to report and communicate diagnostic errors along with physicians' comfort with error reporting. From June 2016 to March 2017, surveys were administered anonymously via e-mail or by paper during educational conferences. Comparison testing across experience was performed using chi-squared tests. Results: Of 484 physicians (87 attendings, 397 residents) targeted, 266 (55%) responded, with a total of 70 attendings and 196 residents. We found that training programs most frequently encouraged residents to report diagnostic errors by having them tell attending physicians (62.2%), tell senior residents (55.3%), and to use anonymous reporting systems (53.9%). Diagnostic errors were also addressed in programs by informal feedback with a team member (41.1%), formal group discussion (e.g., morbidity and mortality conference) (36.4%), or not addressed at all (8.7%). Trainees were less likely than attend-ings to state that their training program explicitly teaches residents how to communicate diagnostic errors (43.5% vs. 64.7%, p < 0.01). Trainees also differed from attendings in that they were less likely to feel that residents were encouraged to report errors in their program to senior residents (59.4% vs. 44.8%; p = 0.04), chief residents (20.9% vs. 32.9%; p = 0.05), attendings (56.1% vs. 79.1%; p < 0.01), or program directors (9.6% vs. 19.4%; p = 0.04). Interns were less likely than residents to report that they should notify an attending of a diagnostic error (52.0% v 60.7%,p = 0.02) and less likely to state that they are encouraged to use anonymous electronic reporting systems (41.0% v. 63.1%, p = 0.008). Many respondents were uncomfortable reporting diagnostic errors, with trainees being less comfortable than attendings (55.4% vs. 69.1%, p = 0.05). Conclusions: In this multi-center study on diagnostic error, we found that residency programs may not consistently teach trainees how to report diagnostic errors and trainees are less likely to feel comfortable reporting errors. Inconsistencies and lack of reporting has the potential of putting patients at undue risk for future errors.","L622329622     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

M. and Ratanawongsa, N.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Patients who leave hospitals against medical advice (AMA) may be at risk for adverse health outcomes. Their decision to leave may not be clearly understood by providers. This study explored providers' experiences with and attitudes toward patients who leave the hospital AMA. OBJECTIVE: To explore providers' experiences with and attitudes toward patients who leave the hospital AMA. METHODS: We conducted interviews with university-based internal medicine residents and practicing internal medicine clinicians caring for patients at a community hospital from July 2006 to August 2007. We approached 34 providers within 3 days of discharging a patient AMA. The semi-structured instrument elicited perceptions of care, emotions, and challenges faced when caring for patients who leave AMA. Using an editing analysis style, investigators independently coded transcripts, agreeing on the coding template and its application. PARTICIPANTS: All 34 providers (100%) participated. Providers averaged 32.6 years of age, 22 (61%) were men, 20 (59%) were housestaff from three residency programs, 13 (38%) were faculty, hospitalist physicians, or chief residents serving as ward attendings, and one (3%) was a physician assistant. MAIN RESULTS: Four themes emerged: 1) providers' beliefs that patients lack insight into their medical conditions; 2) suboptimal communication, mistrust, and conflict; 3) providers' attempts to empathize with patients' concerns; and 4) providers' professional roles and obligations toward patients who leave AMA. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that patients who leave AMA influence providers' perceptions of their patients' insight, and their own patient-provider communication, empathy for patients, and professional roles and obligations. Future research should investigate educational interventions to optimize patient-centered communication and support providers in their decisional conflicts when these challenging patient-provider discussions occur.","1525-1497     Windish, Donna M     Ratanawongsa, Neda     Comparative Study     Journal Article     United States     J Gen Intern Med. 2008 Oct;23(10):1698-707. doi: 10.1007/s11606-008-0728-4.

RESULTS: Eighty chief residents completed the survey for a response rate of 37%. Forty-five respondents (56%) reported that during their residency training they received 3 or fewer hours of training in genomics. Of these, 13 reported that they had received no training in genomics. Chief residents who received 3 or fewer hours of training were more likely to indicate that they had not actively participated in a multidisciplinary team which utilized genetic/genomic specialists than residents who had received more didactic training in genomics (p<0.001). Although 67% of 77 respondents indicated that they understood the concept of genetic predisposition to psychiatric disease, only 14% of 80 respondents indicated that they understood the role a genetic counselor could play on a clinical team.

It fundamentally asks the question, ""What is a RET and do we need one?"" DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Program directors, associate program directors, educators, program coordinators, and chief residents from Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) general surgery training programs were asked to anonymously complete a survey categorized into 3 sections: (1) roles and responsibilities, (2) views of his/her RET and team members, and (3) general views about RETs. All respondents provided their opinions on the importance of a RET for administering and leading a surgical residency, whom the ideal members would be, and the main outcomes of a high-functioning RET. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 167) included 59 (35.3%) program directors, 16 (9.6%) associate program directors, 8 (4.8%) educators, 67 (40.1%) program coordinators, and 6 (3.6%) chief residents.

C. and Park, Y. and DaRosa, D. and Tekian, A.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L616279263,English,,,"OBJECTIVES: Obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) residency training in gynecologic (GYN) surgery has been affected by increasing faculty supervision and decreasing resident autonomy. Post-residency supervisors report concerns of new graduate competency to perform routine procedures, such as hysterectomy. GYN surgical educators need better guidance on resident learning needs and their surgical preparation. This study investigates OB/GYN residents and faculty members' perceptions of unmet resident operative learning needs and resident preparatory practices for the GYN operating room to inform better alignment with learners and improve surgical curricula. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following IRB approval, a crosssectional survey developed with validity evidence was administered in May 2016 via email weblink to a registry of 19 OB/GYN programs (14 university, 5 community) and distributed to residents and GYN faculty. Respondents were surveyed on (1) resources that residents utilize to prepare for GYN surgical cases and frequency of use and (2) a list of 12 operative learning needs including preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative content with a dichotomous scale (YES/NO) to identify those that remained unmet learning needs despite traditional preparation for GYN cases. Resident respondents were self-assessed on their competency in the three GYN technical skill milestones (abdominal, vaginal, endoscopic skills). Data were analyzed using chi-square tests and t-tests. RESULTS: Survey respondents included 214 OB/GYN residents and 199 GYN faculty members. Both residents and faculty reported advice from colleagues was the most frequent resident resource utilized to prepare for GYN cases followed by web-based materials, most commonly YouTube. Residents (91%) reported a significantly greater use of YouTube than faculty (83%) perceived resident use (p = 0.019). In contrast, GYN society sites with peerreviewed material had significantly less actual resident use (31%) compared to faculty perceptions (59%; p < 0.001). Faculty perceived anatomy (75%) to be the most common unmet resident learning need, which was significantly higher than residents self-reported (65%; p < 0.028). Significant differences were noted on 5 topics between faculty and residents (p < 0.05). Of the 57 chief residents, less than 40% self-assessed at the graduation target for all three GYN technical skill milestones. Vaginal surgery milestone skills had the lowest achievement with 61% of residents self-assessing below target. CONCLUSION: This study reveals a divergence in faculty and resident perceptions and a misalignment in the operative learning environment. Our findings warrant attention to resident reliance on colleague advice and unrestricted web-based resources, which may not always conform to best-practice guidelines, to prepare for GYN cases. Faculty awareness of residents' unmet learning needs and their preparatory approaches is important to inform surgical education development, such as resident readiness curricula and to address gaps in preparation. To meet standards for excellence in the competency-based medical education era, the field needs concerted efforts to align resident learning needs and use evidence-based instructional approaches and systems of assessment methods.","L616279263     2017-05-23

K. and Burgess, L. and Kaminetzky, C. and McNeill, D. and Pinheiro, S. and Heflin, M. T.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Residency program directors rely on an informal network of faculty mentors to provide guidance for residents. Faced with increasingly sophisticated competency-based evaluation systems and scrutiny of patient safety and resident well-being in today's environment, residency programs need more structured mechanisms for mentoring. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the role of resident advisors and mentors so that residents receive the right combination of direction and oversight to ensure their successful transition to the next phase of their careers. METHODS: The Duke Internal Medicine Residency Program undertook a formal assessment of the roles, responsibilities, and resource needs of its key faculty through a focus group made up of key faculty. A follow-up focus group of residents and chief residents was held to validate the results of the faculty group assessment. RESULTS: The distinction between advising and mentoring was our important discovery and is supported by literature that identifies that mentors and advisors differ in multiple ways. A mentor is often selected to match resources and expertise with a resident's needs or professional interests. An advisor is assigned with a role to counsel and guide the resident through the residency processes, procedures, and key learning milestones. CONCLUSION: The difference between the role of advisor and that of mentor is of critical importance and allowed for the evolution of faculty participants' role as resident advisors, including the formulation of expectations for advisors, and the creation of an advisor toolkit. Our modifiable toolkit can enhance the advising process for residents in many disciplines. We saw an improvement in resident satisfaction from 2006 to 2009.","1949-8357     Woods, Suzanne K     Burgess, Leigh     Kaminetzky, Catherine     McNeill, Diana     Pinheiro, Sandro     Heflin, Mitchell T     Journal Article     United States     J Grad Med Educ. 2010 Jun;2(2):195-200. doi: 10.4300/JGME-D-09-00089.1.

Barriers to contraception counseling (CC) 2. Knowledge of methods, efficacy, and contraindications 3. Identify commonly prescribe teratogenic meds 4. Attitudes towards Shared Decision Making (SDM) and CC Setting and Participants: The survey was distributed to the IM and Med/Peds PGY-2-3 residents at the University of Chicago. A similar survey was also distributed to the IM and Med/Peds faculty who serve as preceptors in the resident clinics. Description: CDC guidelines state PCPs should provide CC and prescribe the selected method or refer for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) placement. IM and Med/Peds physicians are responsible for providing care to medically complex women, yet studies have shown that inadequate knowledge in CC. SDM is a method of communication that can improve patient satisfaction and promote adherence with contraception. We propose an innovative curriculum to teach residents CC through the framework of SDM. This is a needs assessment of the residents' and faculty's knowledge of and attitudes towards CC and SDM. Evaluation: Two cross-sectional surveys were designed after review of the literature on SDM, CC and resident education in contraception. A panel of women's health and med ed experts at the Universities of Chicago and Pittsburgh vetted this survey, and it was piloted with the chief resident. Paper surveys were distributed at departmental meetings. Descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were performed. 38 residents and 23 attendings completed the survey (50% and 67%). 78% of faculty and 66% of residents think it is very important that residents learn about CC. 22% of faculty and 37% of residents felt they had not received adequate education. On a Likert scale (1=need close supervision, and 5=can teach others), residents reported a median comfort of 3 (IQR 2-3) for prescribing contraception. Faculty ranked their level of comfort on a similar adjusted Likert scale with only 17% reporting comfort teaching CC. Med/Peds faculty reported greater comfort prescribing contraception (median 3.5 (IQR 3-4)) than IM faculty (median 2 (IQR 2-3) p=0.03). Female residents were more confident prescribing (median 3) compared to males (median 2, p=0.02) and discussing efficacy (median 3 and 2, p=0.01). The majority of both providers under-recognized the effectiveness of the implant. 11% of residents and 13% of faculty recognized atorva-statin as a teratogen. Discussion/Reflection/Lessons Learned: While providers feel CC is important there is a lack of knowledge and faculty are not comfortable teaching this topic. There are gender-based differences in comfort with contraception topics among residents. All providers under-recognize the efficacy of the hormonal implant and do not always correctly identify teratogenic medications. Based on these results, we will emphasize LARCs and teratogen-ic medication management in the curriculum.","L622329421     2018-05-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional mail survey. SETTING: Accredited US pediatric residency programs. PARTICIPANTS: Pediatric chief residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reported frequencies of patient counseling performed on various injury prevention topics. RESULTS: All residents reported that they were expected to educate patients and families about injury prevention in the continuity clinic setting. Almost all residents (98.5%) reported that they counseled on at least 1 injury prevention topic. On all topics except for poisoning prevention, residents were most likely to counsel patients and families on those topics about which they had received education. Additionally, those residents familiar with the American Academy of Pediatrics The Injury Prevention Program included more injury prevention topics in their counseling repertoire (P = .01). The most frequently identified barriers to counseling included lack of information about the topic and lack of time in the visit. CONCLUSIONS: Most pediatric residents counsel their patients and families on a variety of injury prevention topics. This activity is promoted by the education offered during residency training. Focused efforts should be made to educate residents about those injury topics not being taught and to address counseling barriers with educational interventions that promote prevention counseling during patient visits.","Wright, M S     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1997 Oct;151(10):1039-43.

M. and Brancati, F. L.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Although effective role models are important in medical education, little is known about the characteristics of physicians who serve as excellent clinical role models. We therefore conducted a case-control study to identify attributes that distinguish such physicians from their colleagues. METHODS: We asked members of the internal-medicine house staff at four teaching hospitals to name physicians whom they considered to be excellent role models. A total of 165 physicians named by one or more house-staff members were classified as excellent role models (these served as the case physicians in our study). A questionnaire was sent to them as well as to 246 physicians who had residency-level teaching responsibilities but who were not named (controls). Of these 411 physicians, 341 (83 percent) completed questionnaires while unaware of their case-control status. RESULTS: Of the 341 attending physicians who responded, 144 (42 percent) had been identified as excellent role models. Having greater assigned teaching responsibilities was strongly associated with being identified as an excellent role model. In the multivariate analysis, five attributes were independently associated with being named as an excellent role model: spending more than 25 percent of one's time teaching (odds ratio, 5.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.81 to 14.47), spending 25 or more hours per week teaching and conducting rounds when serving as an attending physician (odds ratio, 2.48; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 5.37), stressing the importance of the doctor-patient relationship in one's teaching (odds ratio, 2.58; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 6.43), teaching the psychosocial aspects of medicine (odds ratio, 2.31; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.35), and having served as a chief resident (odds ratio, 2.07; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 3.98). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that many of the attributes associated with being an excellent role model are related to skills that can be acquired and to modifiable behavior.","Wright, S M     Kern, D E     Kolodner, K     Howard, D M     Brancati, F L     Journal Article     Multicenter Study     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     N Engl J Med. 1998 Dec 31;339(27):1986-93. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199812313392706.

P. and Newlove, T. and Smith, L. and Vuong, C. H. and Stein, J. A. and Polsky, D.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown low satisfaction levels among dermatology residents with respect to dermoscopy training. Many desire additional instruction. OBJECTIVE: We surveyed graduating chief residents to assess current education practices among US dermatology training programs with respect to the role of dermoscopy as an aid in the management of pigmented lesions. METHODS: An online survey was sent to 139 chief residents of US dermatology training programs. RESULTS: A 59% response rate was achieved. Of responding chief residents, 94% use dermoscopy. Although 92% of chief residents received dermoscopy training, only 48% trained with a pigmented lesion specialist. Among those training without a specialist, less than half received classroom or bedside teaching compared with 77% of those who trained with a specialist. Of those who trained with a specialist, 77% were satisfied with their training compared with only 30% who trained without a specialist (P < .0001). Those who trained with a specialist were more likely to agree that dermoscopy can help differentiate melanoma from benign lesions (77% vs 47%; P = .0065). LIMITATIONS: Response bias and limiting the survey to chief residents potentially limits our ability to generalize these results to all US dermatology trainees. CONCLUSION: Although many residents use dermoscopy as a diagnostic tool, the lack of dedicated dermoscopy training remains a potential barrier to increasing residents' diagnostic confidence in the management of pigmented lesions. Increasing the amount of dedicated instruction on this topic is one possible approach to enhance resident satisfaction, potentially increasing their competency in the management of atypical nevi.","1097-6787     Wu, Timothy Peter     Newlove, Tracey     Smith, Lauren     Vuong, Charlotte Hwa     Stein, Jennifer A     Polsky, David     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Am Acad Dermatol. 2013 Jun;68(6):1000-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2012.11.032.

METHOD: The pattern and frequency of patient encounters during the Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University otolaryngology residency program for one chief resident were retrospectively analyzed. RESULT: A total of 1062 new inpatients were consulted during a 10-month period of otolaryngology residency, including emergency consultation for 467 cases (43.97%) and routine consultation for 595 cases (56.03%). The chief resident consulted an average of 28 new patients perweek. The most common diagnosis for an emergency consultation was epistaxis (279 cases, 59.72% of emergency consultation), characterized by disturbances of blood coagulation, hypertension, renal failure or liver failure, iatrogenic factors. The second cause was laryngeal obstruction and tracheotomy (113 cases, 24.19% of emergency consultation). There were 43 cases with foreign body in bronchus . For routine consultation on general internal medicine, chronic rhinitis and sinusitis (169 cases) was the most common disorder, followed by chronic pharyngitis, acute or chronic tonsillitis. For consultation on surgery, most cases were concerned about preoperative evaluations (67 cases) of the chronic otolaryngological disorders.

However, surgical site infection(SSI) is still an important issue in medical care. SSI will increase length of stay, healthcare expense and workload of healthcare workers (HCWs). Objectives: In the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery in a tertiary teaching hospital, the rate of SSI was 0.94% (January 2014 to April 2104), and increased to 4.46% (May 2014 to June 2014). In order to decrease the rate of SSIs, some measurements were applied. Methods: The factors may contribute the increased rate of SSI, which including no consensus in use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery, no identical method of wound care, and the insufficient implementation of hand hygiene. After discussion some measurements were applied. First, the chief resident prescribed the antibiotic before surgery based on the guideline. Second, we revised the standard procedure of wound care. The procedure was announced to the HCWs and supervised by nurse practitioners and infection control nurses. Results: After introducing these measurements, the rate of surgical site infection decreased to 0.93% at the period of August 2014 to January 2015, compared to 4.46% at the period of May 2014 to June 2014. Our results show that implementation can reduce surgical site infection incidence. Conclusion: Surgical site infection is a common complication of surgery, which may reduce the quality of life, even leading to morbidity or mortality. Healthcare workers should had consensus in care of surgical wound and execute it carefully, in order to prevent further healthcare associated infection. After the teamwork with healthcare workers, the rate of surgical site infection reduced.

However, there are multiple hurdles that must be crossed to obtain these devices. Purpose: We explored the behaviors of psoriasis patients with respect to obtaining a home phototherapy unit after given a prescription. In addition, we examined differences in physicians' prescribing patterns for home phototherapy versus biologics. Methods: We reviewed survey data from National Biologic Corporation, a manufacturer of phototherapy units, to determine the number of patients who never acquired a home unit after given a prescription from their doctors, and their respective reasons why they did not. Physicians' prescribing patterns were assessed from data gathered by IMS Health. Physician education of and willingness to prescribe home phototherapy was assessed via a survey distributed at the Ninth Annual Dermatology Chief Residents' Meeting. Results: Over a 2-year period, 45% of patients that were written a prescription never obtained a phototherapy unit. Of these patients, 72% stated that they did not get a unit secondary to the potential high out of pocket expenses. In 2006, 94,385 new prescriptions for etanercept were written by 4284 dermatologists in the IMS database. These same physicians only wrote 1746 prescriptions for home phototherapy. Only 35% of dermatology residents received formal training on home phototherapy. Conclusions: When it comes to patients receiving more expensive biologics instead of home phototherapy for their psoriasis, high copays and deductibles are just the tip of the iceberg. It is likely that even more patients are never prescribed a home unit because of a lack of training or frustration with lack of insurance coverage.","L70142902     2010-05-25

Technical performance scores were also strongly correlated (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001), whereas perceptions of autonomy demonstrated a moderate correlation (r = 0.56, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis revealed very strong correlations among faculty perceptions of case complexity and the perceptions of PGY 1 (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001) and chief residents (r = 0.82, p < 0.0001). All other intergroup correlations were strong with 2 notable exceptions as follows: midlevel and chief residents failed to correlate with faculty perceptions of autonomy and operative performance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: General surgery residents generally demonstrated high correlations with faculty perceptions of case complexity, technical performance, and operative autonomy. This generalized accord supports the use of the Milestone and Zwisch assessments in residency programs. However, discordance among perceptions of midlevel resident autonomy and chief resident operative performance suggests that these trainees may need more direct communication from the faculty.","1878-7452     Young, Katelyn A     Lane, Samantha M     Widger, John E     Neuhaus, Nina M     Dove, James T     Fluck, Marcus     Hunsinger, Marie A     Blansfield, Joseph A     Shabahang, Mohsen M     Journal Article     United States     J Surg Educ. 2017 Nov - Dec;74(6):e31-e38. doi: 10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.05.021.

A national survey of PM&R programs was conducted to determine CR number, selection method, responsibilities, duration of service, and postresidency destiny. The questionnaire generated a response rate of 86% with 90% of programs reporting 1-3 CRs per year. A range of 1-11 CRs were selected annually per program. The most common methods of CR selection were faculty vote (45%), combined resident-faculty vote (22%), and other (33%). The prevalence of administrative responsibilities included orienting new residents (97%), formulating call schedules (92%), dispute mediation (88%), medical student-residency interviews (87%), rotation schedule configuration (64%), faculty meeting participation (61 %), social event promotion (59%), and elective and externship schedule development (31 %). Educational duties included teaching and organizing didactics (87%), organizing pharmaceutical and rehabilitation equipment inservices (77%), arranging didactics (77%), board review coordination (72%), arranging grand round speakers (66%), core curriculum lectures (61%), and facilitating resident research (37%). CR career goals included group practice (48%), academic faculty (29%), solo practice (5%), and fellowship (18%). Overall, PM&R CRs maintain considerable involvement in the educational aspects of residency training, although their clinical and administrative duties predominate.

To clarify the impact of experience of the operators on the outcome of IVF/ICSI, we divided the surgeons into experienced and inexperienced surgeons. The main inexperienced surgeons were local clinical physicians, chief residents and fellow physicians. Antral follicle count, number of oocytes, good-quality embryos for transfer, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate and take home baby were analyzed. RESULTS: The number of antral follicle count, clinical pregnancy, and take home baby rate per cycle were significantly lower in the inexperienced group compared to the experienced group. (Table presented) However, all other parameters, including mean number of oocytes, meta-phase II oocytes, fertilization rate, the mean number of embryos transferred, implantation rate, and the rate of good quality embryos transferred were comparable among the two groups.

At our institution, which trains over 190 pediatric residents each year, educational conferences were not systematically evaluated and hence feedback was inconsistently provided to presenters. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objectives were to 1) develop a system for real-time assessment of twice-daily conferences and 2) develop a standardized approach for disseminating actionable feedback to presenters to optimize conference quality. METHODS: We developed a brief 6 item survey that was intended to be completed by residents immediately following daily morning and noon conferences. In addition to questions on conference type, date and topic, respondents assessed speaker engagement and topic relevance via a 5 point Likert scale. An additional free text item allowed for comments. A Google form was utilized to administer the survey, allowing repeated use without alteration needed for each conference. A link to the form was disseminated to residents via weekly emails and on the residency website and can be saved on a phone home screen, allowing one-click access following conference. Residents were encouraged to complete the surveys in real-time, allowing feedback to be aggregated and shared via email with the presenters using a standardized form. Resident- or chief resident-generated actionable steps for improvement were offered when indicated. RESULTS: The tool was utilized July-Dec 2015, with 1,020 individual conference evaluations submitted for faculty-delivered conferences. The average response rate per conference was 12. Results were aggregated and sent to presenters with actionable suggestions for improvement within one month of the presentation. CONCLUSION: Adoption of a brief, reusable, electronic survey generates both real-time conference evaluation and timely, actionable feedback for presenters. Future directions include assessing the impact of the feedback on speaker engagement and educational content of the conferences.","L619743901     2017-12-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

N.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71101450,English,,,"Background: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) is informally defined as an assessment of all available efficacious options for a specific medical condition, with intent to estimate effectiveness and efficiency in specific subpopulations. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $1.8 B to increase CER and train physicians in its practice. Although program directors (PDs) of medical oncology (MO) and radiation oncology (RO) training programs know that CER is emphasized nationally, it is unknown if CER is emphasized in oncological training programs themselves. We examine the emphasis of CER in MO and RO training programs. Methods: A web-based, anonymous survey was sent to RO PDs (n = 85) and chief residents (CRs; 98); and MO PDs (99), asking them to forward a link to fellows (Fs; 160). Mean weighted Likerts (MWLs ± standard deviations [SDs]) were calculated from scales (1, strongly disagree; 3, neutral; 5, strongly agree). Results: The response rates for RO PDs, RO CRs, MO PDs, and MO Fs were 20%, 21%, 11%, and 10% (combined, 15%, 68/442). Respondents had mixed beliefs in having a clear definition of CER (MWL, 3.1 ± 1.2); their programs encouraging CER (3.2 ± 1.2); including a course on CER (2.3 ± 0.9); or discussing the differences among efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency (2.9 ± 0.9). Retrospective cohort studies were easy to perform at institutions (4.3 ± 0.8), but less so CER (3.1 ± 1.3). Respondents believed their programs' research integrated some core values of CER, including comparing treatments to influence clinical decision making (4.6 ± 0.7). Respondents believed CER was important (4.3 ± 0.7); 47% would divert funding from other types of research toward CER; 35% would, only if funding for other research was unaffected. Conclusions: CER is not emphasized in oncologic training programs, and most PDs and trainees cannot clearly define CER. In the era of health care reform and potential future payment reforms, it is anticipated that CER will become an increasingly important component of evidence-based medicine and continuous quality improvement. This study identifies a need for oncology training programs to incorporate education about CER into their curricula.","L71101450     2013-07-04 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

One of the six Pathways to Excellence delineates pathways for enhancing resident education about patient safety. OBJECTIVE: The Pediatric Chief Residents revised departmental conferences to incorporate the Patient Safety Pathways and to more fully engage residents in a safety culture METHODS: During monthly Quality and Safety conferences, each resident on the inpatient team is tasked with presenting a safety event or near miss during their inpatient experience. The lead senior resident chooses one event and describes an intervention implemented. Residents then enter the events into the system- wide online safety net. Quarterly Morbidity and Mortality conferences address core safety topics, focus on sentinel events from across the department, and more fully review the events on the inpatient service. RESULTS: Through these initiatives, residents have demonstrated progress in achieving the PS Pathways. All residents now verbally report events during the Quality and Safety conference, and the institution has documented an increase in events reported by pediatric residents into the system-wide safety net (PS Pathway 1: Reporting of Adverse Events, Close Calls. Open discussion and follow-up regarding analysis of errors and proposed interventions provides education for residents, and occurs in a supportive, non-punitive manner(PS Pathway 2: Education on Patient Safety; PS Pathway 3: Culture of Safety.

METHODS: The Approved Instructional Resources - Professional (AIR-Pro) series is a continuously building curriculum covering a new subject area every two months. For each area, six EM chief residents identify 3-5 advanced clinical questions. Using FOAMsearch.net to search blogs and podcasts, relevant posts are scored by eight reviewers from the AIR-Pro Board, which is comprised of EM faculty and chief residents at various institutions. The scoring instrument contains five measurement outcomes based on 7-point Likert scales: recency, accuracy, educational utility, evidence based, and references. The AIR-Pro label is awarded to posts with a score of >/=26 (out of 35) points. An ""Honorable Mention"" label is awarded if Board members collectively felt that the posts were valuable and the scores were > 20. RESULTS: We included a total of 41 blog posts and podcasts.

OBJECTIVES: 1) To develop and provide evidence of validity for a comprehensive simulation-enhanced training (SET) curriculum for an advanced minimally invasive procedure; (2) to demonstrate transfer of acquired psychomotor skills from a simulation laboratory to live porcine model; and (3) to compare training outcomes of SET curriculum group and chief resident group. SETTING: University. METHODS: This prospective single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial allocated 20 intermediate-level surgery residents to receive either conventional training (control) or SET curriculum training (intervention). The SET curriculum consisted of cognitive, psychomotor, and nontechnical training modules. Psychomotor skills in a live anesthetized porcine model in the OR was the primary outcome. Knowledge of advanced minimally invasive and bariatric surgery and nontechnical skills in a simulated OR crisis scenario were the secondary outcomes. Residents in the SET curriculum group went on to perform a laparoscopic jejunojejunostomy in the OR. Cognitive, psychomotor, and nontechnical skills of SET curriculum group were also compared to a group of 12 chief surgery residents. RESULTS: SET curriculum group demonstrated superior psychomotor skills in a live porcine model (56 [47-62] versus 44 [38-53], P<.05) and superior nontechnical skills (41 [38-45] versus 31 [24-40], P<.01) compared with conventional training group. SET curriculum group and conventional training group demonstrated equivalent knowledge (14 [12-15] versus 13 [11-15], P = 0.47). SET curriculum group demonstrated equivalent psychomotor skills in the live porcine model and in the OR in a human patient (56 [47-62] versus 63 [61-68]; P = .21). SET curriculum group demonstrated inferior knowledge (13 [11-15] versus 16 [14-16]; P<.05), equivalent psychomotor skill (63 [61-68] versus 68 [62-74]; P = .50), and superior nontechnical skills (41 [38-45] versus 34 [27-35], P<.01) compared with chief resident group. CONCLUSION: Completion of the SET curriculum resulted in superior training outcomes, compared with conventional surgery training. Implementation of the SET curriculum can standardize training for an advanced minimally invasive procedure and can ensure that comprehensive proficiency milestones are met before exposure to patient care.","1878-7533     Zevin, Boris     Dedy, Nicolas J     Bonrath, Esther M     Grantcharov, Teodor P     Journal Article     Randomized Controlled Trial     United States     Surg Obes Relat Dis. 2017 May;13(5):815-824. doi: 10.1016/j.soard.2016.11.019.

We herein report the essential components to design and implement a rigorous training course for developing laparoscopic skills in surgical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At our institution, we developed a week-long pilot intensive laparoscopic training course. Six surgical residents (ranging from interns to chief residents) participate in the structured, multimodality course, without any clinical responsibilities. It consists of didactic instruction, laboratory training, practice in the simulation laboratory, and performance (under the direction of attending laparoscopic surgeons) of surgical procedures on pigs. The pigs are anesthetized and attended by veterinarians and technicians, and then euthanized at the end of each day. Three teams of two different training-level residents are paired. Daily briefing, debriefing, and analysis are performed at the close of each session. A written paper survey is completed at the end of the course. RESULTS: This report describes the results of first 36 surgical residents trained in six courses. Preliminary data reveal that all 36 now feel more comfortable handling laparoscopic instruments and positioning trocars; they now perform laparoscopic surgery with greater confidence and favor having the course as part of their educational curriculum. CONCLUSION: A multimodality intensive laparoscopic training course should become a standard requirement for surgical residents, enabling them to acquire basic and advanced laparoscopic skills on a routine basis.","1432-2218     Zimmerman, Hannah     Latifi, Rifat     Dehdashti, Behrooz     Ong, Evan     Jie, Tun     Galvani, Carlos     Waer, Amy     Wynne, Julie     Biffar, David     Gruessner, Rainer     Journal Article     Germany     Surg Endosc. 2011 Nov;25(11):3636-41. doi: 10.1007/s00464-011-1770-6.

D. and Solaiman, A. and McKeone, D. and Krawiec, C. and Smith, B. and Ceneviva, G.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L619744107,English,,,"INTRODUCTION: Upon completion of training, pediatric residents are expected to be able to recognize and provide initial stabilization for critically ill children. Given the relative rarity of critically ill children outside of the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), pediatric residents receive most of their exposure to critical care during their PICU rotations. However, due to seasonal variations in disease presentations and the ebbs and flow of patient care, residents' experiences during their PICU rotation vary even within the same institution. This may lead to different learning opportunities, with some residents receiving little to no exposure to certain important topics during their PICU rotation. METHODS: The authors reviewed both the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education program requirements for graduate medical education in pediatrics as well as the content outline published by the American Board of Pediatrics for the General Pediatrics certification examination. Considering resident exposures during other rotations, 21 topics were chosen as being most important to be taught by PICU faculty. Of the 21 topics, 13 were designated core topics and the other 8 were designated supplementary topics. These topics were presented in the form of a PICU Passport, which also included certain basic reference information for residents to use as a resource during their PICU rotation. RESULTS: Residents were provided a PICU Passport at the beginning of their 4-week PICU rotation, during which each resident was expected to hear about 10/13 core topics and 4/ 8 supplementary topics from a PICU faculty member. Completed Passports were due back to the pediatric chief residents. PICU faculty members were provided learning objectives for each topic, and were asked to cover requested topics either during rounds, small group discussions, or in 1on1 discussions. Feedback will be sought from residents via pre and postrotation surveys, as well as from faculty 6 months after implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The PICU Passport targets specific topics to be covered during the PICU rotation, helping pediatric residents achieve a standard and baseline exposure to certain high yield topics. The Passport also assists PICU faculty streamline teaching time to individual residents' learning needs.","L619744107     2017-12-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population"

However, while medical students often start their training with idealism, a number of studies have found a decrease in empathy towards the latter part of medical education. Many strategies for teaching empathy to students and residents have been proposed and studied. These strategies address different aspects of empathyemotive, moral, cognitive, and behavioral. In a review by Stepien and Baernstein, interpersonal skills workshops, audiotape workshops, and communications skills workshops lasting between 3 and 16 h showed statistically significant improvements in pre- and post-training assessments. However, the improvements did not create a lasting impact on empathic skills, suggesting that reinforcement of these skills is necessary. Some authors have suggested that in order to create a lasting impact, empathy training should be a standardized component of medical education, with follow-up empathy training in each year of residency and frequent reinforcement by supervisors. Most medical school curricula include some degree of empathy training during the basic science years. However, teaching empathy during the clerkship years and residency is more challenging as clinical exposure and subject matter knowledge take precedence. To address the perceived deficit in empathy training during clinical clerkships, one of the authors, a former chief resident (Department of Psychiatry, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY) designed a 1-h class for students to reinforce empathy-related learning from the early medical school years.

R.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27040043,English,,,"OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study reassesses the status of headache didactics and clinical training in adult neurology residency programs in the United States to determine if program directors and chief residents feel that current training in headache is adequate. BACKGROUND: Headache is among the most common new complaints to both the neurology and primary care clinic and represents a significant economic burden. However, headache remains both under-diagnosed and under-treated. Of those who seek treatment only 28% report they are very satisfied with their management. One possible cause for dissatisfaction is inadequate education of treating physicians. Two studies in 2002 and 2005 that collectively surveyed all 125 adult neurology residency programs concluded that more evidence was needed to evaluate the adequacy of headache education in these programs. A survey of neurology residency department chairs and program directors in 2005 also evaluated the status of headache education in adult neurology training programs and concluded the same. METHODS: We surveyed 133 neurology residency program directors and 213 chief residents. Program directors and chief residents were asked about the amount of headache didactics, amount of clinical exposure to headache, perceived adequacy of current training and if plans existed to increase headache education through didactics or clinical exposure. RESULTS: Seventy-two program directors (54%) and 117 chief residents (55%) responded. Twenty-six percent of programs reported a mandatory headache clinic. Of these, 35% of programs reported <2 weeks of clinic, 54% of programs reported 2-4 weeks, and 12% of programs reported > 4 weeks of clinic. Fifty-one percent of program directors felt more than 4 weeks of clinical exposure to headache was needed to adequately prepare neurology residents. Ninety-six percent of program directors surveyed believed their residents were adequately prepared to diagnose and treat headache disorders. Twenty-one percent had plans to increase didactic time and 26% planned to incorporate more clinical exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a modest increase in headache didactics in neurology residency programs over the last decade, many program directors and chief residents report that their programs do not include what they believe to be adequate educational experiences in headache. Although the overwhelming majority of neurology residency programs reported that residents were adequately prepared to diagnose and treat headache disorders, about a fourth of programs still felt the need to increase the amount of didactic and clinical exposure dedicated toward the management of headache disorders.","Ahmed, Zubair A     Faulkner, Larry R     eng     Headache. 2016 Apr 4. doi: 10.1111/head.12822.

We propose a novel neurosurgical complication classification system focusing on operative complications. We base our classification on our previously published paper on complications in endovascular neurosurgery. The system compiles the complication in five groups; indication errors, technical complications, judgement errors, critical events and procedural errors. METHODS: We created our own neurosurgical complication classification system and prospectively analyzed and classified all our complications accordingly during the monthly morbidity and mortality conference at a single institution. The complications were captured and presented by neurosurgery chief residents. The classification was done by a single neurosurgery attending during the M&M conference. We compiled and analyzed our six-month results. We also performed a subgroup analysis of complications in neurosurgical subspecialties (general, spine, skull base, neuro-oncology, trauma, vascular, peripheral nerve and functional). RESULTS: There was a total of 64 neurosurgical complications during the six-month period; 55% of those were critical events and 28% were technical complications followed by Indication errors (9%), procedural (5%) and judgement errors (3%). Within the neurosurgical subspecialties, vascular neurosurgery (28%) had the most complications followed by spine (25%), trauma (14%), neuro-oncology (14%), general neurosurgery (11%), peripheral nerve (1%) and functional neurosurgery. CONCLUSION: In this study, we present a novel neurosurgical complication classification system. Our six-month analysis reveals that the most common subtype of complications were critical events followed by technical complications. The subspecialty with most complications were vascular neurosurgery followed by spine and neuro-trauma. Our study has limitations in terms of subjective complication reporting and subjective analysis, as well as difficulty in interpreting patient outcomes and implications of the complications on patient life.

K. and Baksh, S. and Chapman, K. and Law, N. and Thomas, S. and Lodhi, A.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000209142900065,English,,,"BACKGROUND: A direct consequence of the enactment of the duty-hour standards by Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education in 2003 followed by further modifications in 2010 has been an increase in the number of hand-offs taking place. Breakdown in communication has been cited as the leading root cause of sentinel events by The Joint Commission. A transition task force consisting of interns, residents, chief resident and faculty mentor was formed to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the written signouts created by interns at a teaching community hospital. METHODS: The transition task force used the 'ANTICIPATE' checklist proposed by Vidyarthi et al. as a framework for assessing the accuracy and completeness of the signout. They identified 28 variables that were grouped into 9 categories: demographic data, admitting complaint and diagnosis, medications & allergies, assessment & plan, baseline vital signs and mental status, recent procedures and significant events, follow up plan, primary team contact information and organization of content. Signouts were obtained from 17 interns (77%) on 4 randomly selected weekdays over a course of 2 weeks. The collected data was corroborated by cross-checking the patient charts. Data was recorded and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The average intern score for accurate and complete signout was around 60% (16.77 ±3.05 of 28 points). The categories which achieved accurate completion score of over 80% included organization of content (88± 1) and documentation of recent procedures and significant events (92±1). The categories that were accurately documented less than 50% included assessment and plan (21%±0) and baseline vital signs and mental status (2%±3). Medication and allergies received an average score of 56% and Primary team contact information received an average score of 51%. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that there is substantial variability in the accuracy and completeness of the interns' signouts. Multiple categories of critical significance are deficient indicating the need for standardization of signouts as well as provision of handoffs training to all interns and residents. This study also provides an approach to evaluate the accuracy and completion of signouts for physicians in training. The next step for the transition task force is to create a standardized template and conduct a handoffs workshop for interns and residents.

J.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000402876300360,English,,,"Introduction Older adults with multiple progressing illnesses and geriatric syndromes need interprofessional teams to optimize care. There are insufficient numbers of trained geriatrics experts; it is critical to devise practical ways to train frontline clinicians in geriatrics and palliative care principles. To meet this need, with support from a HRSA grant, the authors devised a new Immersion Course modeled on the successful CRIT program (Chief Resident Immersion Training in the Care of Older Adults). Basic changes to the CRIT structure included: Broadening the learners to include a wide range of trainees and professionals, shifting to the outpatient setting, substituting quality improvement training for chief resident skills training, emphasizing dementia, palliative care and the importance of interprofessional teams. Participants Roughly 70 people attended including students and clinicians, senior executives, doctors, MAs, RNs, social workers, chaplains, PAs, NPs, PT, administrators, pharmacists, etc. Course The course was held at a mountain resort over a day and a half. It interspersed mini-lectures with 3 case modules depicting a patient with progressing dementia. The lectures were given by interprofessional faculty pairs and the discussion groups and communication skills training were structured to maximize interprofessional learning. Didactic sessions included introductions to the 3 Ds, caregiver stress, falls, frailty, hospice, etc. Quality improvement exercises and coaching focused on several projects launched as part of Baystate Health's Geriatric Work Force Enhancement Program. Additional activities included a senior leadership panel, a Geri-Pal Jeopardy game and a pill drill testing the ability to comply with a candy drug regimen. Results Average pre-test scores = 59%; the post-test average rose to 80%. This improvement is consistently across all professions and experience levels. All participants were enthusiastic in their evaluations and they reported that the content was at the right level. Conclusion This new immersion course for interprofessional team was well accepted and successfully imparted core geriatrics, palliative care and quality improvement content while fostering interprofessional teamwork. This conference could serve as a model for how to train the existing workforce to better care for vulnerable elderly. This is the first report of such a course in the literature.","Suppl. 1 Sp. Iss.

E. and Julian, K. and Dulay, M. H. and Patel, S.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000340996203098,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Internal medicine residents spend approximately two-thirds of their training in the inpatient setting. With new duty hour changes and requirements, many training programs find it increasingly difficult to teach internal medicine interns how to provide effective primary care. Barriers include limited time spent in continuity clinic, patient complexity, and complex systems of care in resident continuity clinic settings. Our objective in designing this curriculum is to improve intern ambulatory medical knowledge, clinic systems of care knowledge and skills, and to enhance satisfaction with the continuity clinic experience. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All internal medicine interns at UCSF residency program were scheduled to take part in a one-month intensive ambulatory curriculum from June 2013 through January 2014 during the first 6 months of internship. Interns participated in the curriculum grouped by their clinic site: a university-based clinic, a Veteran Administration-based clinic and a county hospital-based clinic. Core clinic faculty, allied healthcare providers, and the ambulatory chief resident delivered the curriculum. DESCRIPTION: Core ambulatory faculty from each clinic site met and agreed upon the immersion curriculum topics to be covered. This month-long intern immersion curriculum involved: 1. Increased continuity clinic sessions; 2. Ambulatory core didactics to increase medical knowledge on common primary care complaints and diseases; 3. Targeted curriculum aimed at enhancing effective team-based care through shadowing interdisciplinary team members and receiving interactive didactics from allied healthcare providers (ex: physical therapy, mental health providers, and social work); 4. Interactive didactics focused on navigating clinic systems including charting effectively in an electronic medical record, telephone and electronic communication with patients, and panel management; 5. Reflective sessions to allow interns to discuss challenges and accomplishments encountered in developing their ambulatory care skills; and 6. Dedicated time and opportunities to develop relationships with outpatient mentors. EVALUATION: We delivered this educational innovation customized for each of our continuity clinical sites to 58 interns over 6 months. All internal medicine interns were surveyed every month from July 2013 through February 2014 regarding their perceived efficacy in their continuity clinic using an anonymous (coded by clinic site) paper-based survey tool. Comparisonswill bemade between responses from interns who have completed immersion curriculumto thosewho had not yet received the immersion curriculum in order to assess program effectiveness in improving medical knowledge, efficacy, and competence in continuity clinic settings. Independent evaluations of immersion didactic speakers were also obtained at all three clinic sites in order to guide future sessions and curriculum development. Qualitative data were also collected at the three sites. Examples of resident comments included: The best part was having closely spaced clinic sessions which allowed me to get to know the clinic system and I also benefitted from shadowing a senior resident and learning their work flow. I found it helpful to discuss the approach to a patient with chronic pain... and appreciated learning about evaluating a u-tox result. Preliminary survey data reveal improved self-reported clinical efficacy, familiarity with staff and systems, and medical knowledge in continuity clinic settings. Interns valued shadowing opportunities, which fostered getting to know clinic staff, faculty, and resident mentors on a personal and professional level. The highest rated didactics were practical, concise, case-based sessions. Negative feedback included not receiving curriculum early enough in the academic year and too many sequential didactic sessions in a day. Responses were similar for primary care track and categorical interns. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Essential aspects of this program inclu e scheduling immersion months as early in the academic year as possible, identifying clear learning objectives and checklists for shadowing activities, and involving ancillary team members and associated health professionals with formal and informal teaching responsibilities. Having a large number of learners immersed in clinic simultaneously can be a burden on staff and clinic resources, but developing best practice guidelines will aid core faculty to design and deliver effective immersion curriculum in the future. The success of this educational innovation has prompted discussion on the design and implementation of an advanced clinic immersion month for 2nd year residents to cover higher-level topics. Addressing the primary care workforce shortage requires creative curricular development to engage residents and improve clinic satisfaction so that they may envision rewarding careers as primary care providers.","Suppl. 1     Ao0jz     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

On average, 15-25 residents, 0-2 fellows, and 6-10 faculty attend a morning report session. All residents in the program, as well as fellows or faculty in attendance, are emailed a daily Morning Report Follow-Up (MRFU) within 12 hours of conference. Written by the chief residents, the MRFU emphasizes ABP topics and interesting teaching points, concludes with a practice board PREP question from the AAP, and often includes pertinent literature. The chief residents also publish an educational newsletter called Take 5, which is distributed monthly to attendees at Grand Rounds. The Take 5 focuses on interesting patient cases and includes high-yield educational content. While trainees and faculty have commented on the utility of these educational materials, no formal studies exist to assess the value of either tool. METHODS: This study was approved by our hospital's IRB. The chief residents developed a survey to assess MRFU and Take 5 value. Questions assessed how often recipients read the MRFU and/or Take 5, how often they completed the PREP question, and if they had suggestions for improvement. The survey was distributed via email and paper to all current pediatric residents, and any fellows or faculty who attended morning report since July 2016. RESULTS: Our response rate was 40% (n=68). Of all pediatric resident respondents (n=40), 97% had read a MRFU, and 58% report reading the MRFU at least 3 days/week. Residents did not perceive that their attendance at conference impacted their likelihood to read the MRFU. For faculty (n=22), 95% report reading a MRFU, with 64% reading at least 60% of all MRFUs emailed to them. Residents (95%), fellows (66%) and faculty (68%) access PREP questions via the MRFU. Fifty-five percent of residents and 55% of faculty report answering at least 40- 60% of all MRFU PREP questions. Of all respondents, 56% cite the AAP PREP website as their most preferred format to access PREP questions. Overall, 88% of respondents (87% of residents, 100% of fellows, and 95% of faculty) report reading a Take 5 at least once this academic year. Subjective positive comments include the immediacy, short length, focus on specific learning points, PREP questions, and reinforcement of concepts discussed in morning report. Areas for improvement include shortening the MRFU and distributing the Take 5 in email format in addition to print. CONCLUSIONS: The MRFU and Take 5 educational tools are read by most residents, fellows and faculty, and are found to be valuable, timely and succinct supplements to our current education. Future studies could highlight targeted content areas identified by in training examination (ITE) results and examine outcomes of subsequent resident performance on the ITE.","L617343968     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

N.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000375278600256,English,,,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Standardization of training in performing robotic surgery is lacking. The current ACGME logging system for robotics is the same as every other type of surgery: a resident either performed the surgery or acted as an assistant. This does not accurately reflect actual experience as considerable variation exists in participation on the console. Our objective was to critically analyze our residents' robotic surgery experience using a tool we have developed for logging true operative experience (RoboLog). METHODS: We previously developed a web-based tool to log surgical skill progression, experience, and feedback for common robotic surgical cases deconstructed to their major steps. There is a built-in function for the resident to request that the supervising attending review their performance. RoboLog provides automated summary reports to both residents and attending on a monthly basis and the system can be queried for various types of reports. RESULTS: RoboLog was successfully developed and piloted for one year with participation from 10 residents and 7 attendings from our institution. A total of 310 cases were logged and 35 reviews by faculty were performed. Detailed data on resident experience was obtained. For instance, 82% of the 151 robotic prostatectomies were logged as surgeon, yet transection of the urethra had<35%resident involvement. The level of involvement stratified by post graduate year and procedure was also delineated. We found that the majority of surgical steps are being performed by chief residents and fellows, while intermediate level residents (PGY 3/4) have minimal console involvement (Figure). CONCLUSIONS: The current logging system does not reflect actual participation as a resident who completes only the pelvic lymph node dissection during a prostatectomy will complete the ACGME case logging form identically to a resident who performs the entire surgery from start to finish. RoboLog has provided insightful information to our program which has generated discussion regarding a standardized training curriculum. Residents that have low participation in certain surgical steps can be identified early and this deficit can be rectified. When combined with results with other institutions, benchmarks for participation in surgical steps at certain PGY levels can be developed using the information gleaned from RoboLog.

In general, the chief resident's administrative role is three-pronged: a technical/logistics function, a liaison position, and an educational development/advocacy role. The chief residency commonly coincides with a period in which one is also establishing one's own professional identity and pursuing one's career plans in a more concrete way.

Such changes have included modification of on-call schedules and the adoption of ""night float"" resident coverage. Little is known about the effects of these changes on surgical resident education and perceptions of quality of patient care. STUDY DESIGN: The surgical housestaff and faculty at a single institution completed a 21-point Likert survey. Subjects were asked to compare parameters of resident education, patient care, and resident quality of life before and after institution of a strict 80-hour work week resident training schedule. The number of hours worked per week before and after these changes were reported. American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores were compared for the 2 years before and after implementation of this schedule. Total number of surgical cases performed by graduating chief residents were recorded and compared for the 3 years before and after the schedule changes. RESULTS: Resident work hours reduced significantly after schedule changes were implemented. A majority of surgical residents reported an improvement in quality of life, but residents and faculty perceived changes to have a negative impact on continuity of patient care. Mean ABSITE composite percentile scores significantly improved after the reduction of working hours. ABSITE scores for junior residents improved significantly; no significant differences were noted in scores for senior residents. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in resident work hours has salutary effects on perception of quality of life and basic education for surgical residents. These benefits may come at the expense of patient care, particularly continuity of care. This study did not directly assess patient outcomes but the perceptions of caregivers suggest that patient care may be compromised.

Prior work has demonstrated the benefits of utilizing a collaborative model to facilitate improved integration of CPA into pediatrics residency programs. METHODS: In 2015, we developed the Illinois Community Pediatrics and Advocacy Training Collaborative to organize CPA educators in Illinois, and we conducted a needs assessment of the 11 residency programs in Illinois. We utilized a survey developed by CPA educators in California and New York as a framework for our 26-item survey. RESULTS: 100% of CPA directors and 73% of chief residents completed the survey. 53% of respondents reported using block rotations to teach CPA, 42% used a block rotation with other experiences, and 5% used a longitudinal experience. 50% of block rotations were in the PGY1 year, 43% in PGY2, and 6% in PGY3. Programs addressed many topics recommended by CPTI in their CPA experiences, but they were less likely to incorporate training in: environmental pediatrics (32%) and the role of pediatricians in regional emergency medicine (5%). The greatest barriers for programs in developing and maintaining CPA experiences included time and funding for organization and maintaining community partnerships. 95% of respondents expressed interest in collaborating, especially in legislative advocacy (100%) and curricula and resource sharing (94%). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable variation exists among residency programs in Illinois for CPA training. There may be a need for educational support for programs in environmental pediatrics and the role of pediatricians in emergency medicine. The greatest barrier in directing CPA experiences was time, and the collaborative may help to address this by facilitating sharing of resources, providing opportunities for scholarship, and helping faculty to leverage their scholarship in negotiations regarding their time.","L617343681     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Bridging the Gap Between Perspective and Practice",2013,1,1,Academic Pediatrics,1876-2859,13,4,e3,"Bauer, Karen L. and Hall, Audrey E. and Morey, Elizabeth B. and Blankenburg, Becky L. and Balise, Raymond R.",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L71162285     http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2013.05.009,English,,,"BACKGROUND: The role distribution of pediatric chief residents varies greatly among different programs, with great discrepancy in the balance of clinician, educator, administrator, research and quality improvement roles. It is unclear if this discrepancy is the result of differing goals of the program directors' and chief residents' or rather the result of long-standing program expectations. In 2011, Dabrow et al. found that the chief resident role was primarily administrative, but found that both program directors (PD) and chief residents (CR) valued clinical and educational roles more highly. We hoped to expand upon these findings by seeking to quantify the percentage time spent in these different roles, and compare the actual distribution of these roles to the ideal distribution, as viewed by PD and CR. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to better understand how chief resident time is allocated among clinical, educational, administrative, research and quality improvement roles. Further, we hope to delineate chief residents' and program directors' perceptions of the importance of these roles for a chief resident, and further evaluate if there is agreement about the ideal distribution of these different roles. METHODS: In January 2013 through February 2013, we conducted an IRB-approved, APPD-approved, anonymous on-line survey of all pediatric residency program directors and current pediatric chief residents. The survey was developed using RedCap (grant support UL1 RR025744 from NIH/NCRR). Current response rates shows 119 CR responses (n=331, 36.0% response rate) and 64 PD responses (n=200, 32% response rate). PD responses for actual versus ideal role distribution were compared by paired t-tests, and CR responses for actual versus ideal role distribution were compared using the same statistical test. RESULTS: Both CR and PD think that the overall time spent in an administrative role should significantly decrease, on average by about 10-20% of total time (CR & PD: p<0.0001). Both groups also think that clinical (CR: p<0.0001, PD 0.0050 and research time (CR & PD: p<0.0001) should increase. CR and PD agreed that the current time allotted for quality improvement work is sufficient (CR: p=0.0719, PD: 0.0292). However, CR wanted more educational time (CR: p<0.0001), while PD thought that the allotted time was appropriate (PD: 0.1948). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be overall agreement among pediatric program directors and chief residents that administrative time should decrease, allowing for more involvement in clinical and research work. Further thought must take place at a national level regarding how to automatically build in more clinical, educational and research protected time into the chief resident job description in order to prevent administrative tasks from being the dominating role.","L71162285     2013-09-13 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>true}"

M.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559853,English,,,"SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An Internal Medicine residency program at a large university-affiliated hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The program has approximately 150 medical residents across all years of training. All PGY-2, PGY-3 medicine residents as well as PGY-2, PGY- 3, and PGY-4 Med/Peds residents were included in the survey group. The program currently requires on-line evaluations of attending physicians following inpatient rotations and recommends similar online peer evaluations of other residents. DESCRIPTION: When given a list of 10 potential reasons for not completing evaluations and asked to check all applicable, residents selected the following: online evaluations are unlikely to induce change from the program (39%), feedback will not be incorporated by the attending (21%), and negative feedback hurts recipients' feelings (55%). Residents expressed discomfort with giving negative evaluations due to power imbalance (53%) and fear of negative repercussions including receiving reciprocal negative feedback (37%). When asked to choose one or more of seven options for giving positive feedback to attendings, 82% of residents preferred speaking to the attending, to the program director (50%), or completing online evaluations (29%). For serious concerns, residents favored contacting either the program director (26%) or chief resident (45%), versus online (18%), however 34% would give no feedback in this scenario. 82% of residents favor positioning a neutral third party to hear serious concerns. NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Resident online evaluations of teaching attending physicians at our institution are poorly utilized (13% completion rate), and rarely include actual constructive critiques aimed at improving an attending's teaching skills or the quality of the teaching service. There is sparse medical education literature available on residents giving feedback to superiors. We conducted a survey of junior and senior residents with the following objectives: 1) to better assess why residents choose not to utilize the online evaluation system, 2) the circumstances that make them more or less likely to complete evaluations, and 3) their preferred methods of submitting feedback, if not via online evaluations. We plan to present the findings of the survey to the residency program director and key program administrators in order to enhance the current evaluation system and to improve both the percentage and utility of completed evaluations. EVALUATION: We hope to incorporate our findings into an improved evaluation system. Based on the results, we have recently started oneon- one exit interviews of junior residents with the inpatient associate program director when they rotate off the teaching service. The goal is to obtain anonymous feedback on teaching faculty with the plan to share an aggregate of evaluations with them in a summary statement that removes the temporal connection and individual voice of the online evaluations. We plan to create follow-up surveys to assess attending and resident satisfaction with our new evaluation system as well as collecting data on utilization. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: While the ACGME mandates residents should be able to complete anonymous evaluations of attendings, this survey suggests on-line evaluations may be fulfilling a requirement but not providing any useful information. The business literature suggests giving upward feedback can be risky to one's career and highly critical evaluations of superiors should be avoided. Our results indicate that residents are happy to share positive verbal feedback with an attending, but a safer system needs to be created to allow them to provide critical feedback of teaching attendings. Not only are residents required to evaluate their attendings, but also positions on the teaching service are highly coveted, and interaction with these select clinicians shapes the future our next generation of physicians. It is our obligation to provide our medical students and residents with the highest quality clinicians and teachers available.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Gen Intern Med. 2011 May;26 Suppl 1:S1-620. doi: 10.1007/s11606-011-1730-9.

Performing these tasks laparoscopically can be a tedious, time-consuming endeavor associated with much frustration. We evaluated a mechanically assisted suture and pretied knot device (Quik-Stitch) for performing the basic tasks of suturing and knot tying. METHODS: We performed a time study using 1) intracorporeal suturing and knot tying, 2) intracorporeal suturing and extracorporeal knot tying, and 3) a mechanically assisted suture and pretied knot device (Quik-Stitch). From September 2000 through March 2001, time trials were conducted using each of the different techniques. Three attending surgeons, one with much experience and 2 with less experience, and 2 chief residents, with the least experience, participated in the study. RESULTS: For the experienced surgeon, the average times for intracorporeal knot tying, extracorporeal knot tying, and knot tying with Quik-Stitch were 97.3, 103.9, and 67.7 seconds, respectively.

N. and Pincavage, A.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000392201603165,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Burnout amongst medical professionals is pervasive and it is a growing concern. It is associated with increased rates of depression, suicide, and poor clinical performance. Increased depressive symptoms amongst medical trainees are associated with factors encountered during residency, including perceived medical errors, increased work hours, and stressful life events. Despite increased recognition of physician burnout, little data exists on how it relates to resilience and few interventions focus on developing resilient trainees. Our objectives were to develop and pilot a novel skill-building based curriculum to foster resilience within our intern class. Through this curriculum we aimed to identify the impact of trainee burnout on clinical performance and work-life balance, as well as introduce trainees to basic concepts of resilience including managing expectations and setting realistic goals, finding gratitude, and letting go after stressful clinical events. In addition, we wanted to assess for any change in resilience scores after delivery of our curriculum. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Our resilience curriculum was piloted with the Internal Medicine interns at the University of Chicago over the 2014-2015 academic year. There were four small group sessions delivered from August of 2014 through March of 2015. DESCRIPTION: The curriculum focused on four skill-building workshops-setting realistic goals, managing expectations, letting go after stressful clinical events, and finding gratitude. All sessions were delivered by a chief resident during the outpatient portion of the interns' block schedule. Sessions consisted of 8-10 interns and combined small group discussion, reflection, didactic lecture, and simulated skill-building exercises. Interns were surveyed on their levels of resilience using the Connor-Davidsone Resilience scale (CD- 25). In addition, they were asked to respond to questions on their reported levels of stress, burnout, and involvement in medical errors using a standard Likert scale. These surveys were conducted prior to initiating the resiliency curriculum and again at the completion. EVALUATION: A total of 36 interns completed the resilience curriculum in 2014-2015. The pilot had promising results with 69 % (25/36) of interns stating that the sessions should continue the following year. As a result of the sessions, a majority of interns are more comfortable talking about stress and burnout (64 %, 23/36), are more comfortable talking about medical errors (64 %, 23/36), have the necessary skills to manage stress and burnout (61 %, 22/36), and learned new ways to approach challenges (67 %, 24/36). Half of interns used something they learned outside of the sessions (51 %, 18/35). There were no differences in resilience scores after the curriculum (low resilience pre 10/32 31 % vs. post 17/36 47 % p = 0.22; high resilience pre 7/32 22 % vs. post 4/36 11 % p = 0.33). Qualitative feedback from the interns indicated the sessions fostered a sense of togetherness amongst their peers and provided them with additional support systems. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Small group resilience workshops provided interns with new skills to approach challenges and manage burnout. While we did not demonstrate a quantitative improvement in resilience scores, sessions were well received by interns and provided an open forum for discussing medical errors, stress, and burnout. In addition, the interns' qualitative feedback suggested that these sessions fostered a sense of togetherness with their peers and provided access to additional support systems that may not have been evident at the start of their residency training. While a resilience curriculum for interns shows promise as a way to teach and foster resilience in residents, more in-depth interventions may be required.","Suppl. 2     Ei0yl     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

That land was sold to the state for an academic hospital, and in 1939, ground was broken at the site of the clubhouse for the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute (NPI). We review the history of the NPI and explore its ties to Harvey Cushing, himself a competitive baseball player. Methods: The archives of the NPI and historical documents were reviewed. Results: Eric Oldberg, the last chief resident to run Cushing's service in Boston, joined the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1931. It was during his tenure as Chairman of Neurology and Neurosurgery, that the NPI was built as the first institute in North America to house Neurosurgery, Neurology and Psychiatry departments. The art-deco building was designed as an architectural tribute to the neurosciences. Oldberg was the founder, and he recruited a neuroscience dream team to the NPI, including Percival Bailey. Cushing hired Bailey to create a histological laboratory for brain tumors at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital; Cushing and Bailey's influential monograph on tumors of the glioma group, published in 1926, ultimately led to today's WHO brain tumor classification system. Amongst his achievements at the NPI, Bailey pioneered anterior temporal lobectomy for psychomotor epilepsy. Conclusion: The NPI was the first multi-specialty neuroscience institute in the country. Its founding leadership had a track record of close associations with Harvey Cushing, and, like Cushing, sought to advance the field of Neurosurgery through cross-specialty research and practice.","eng     J Neurosurg. 2016 Apr;124(4):A1146-209. doi: 10.3171/2016.4.JNS.AANS2016abstracts.

Potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) including over-prescription (medication without a valid indication or with contra-indication), under-prescription (failure to prescribe a clinically indicated drug) and mis-prescription (unwanted drug- interaction; incorrect prescribing) is a risk factor for DRPs. Several tools have recently been developed to target PIM. One of them, PIM-Check©, is dedicated to internal medicine patients. The aim of this study was to determine if PIM-Check© electronic application, used by physicians, can decrease DRPs in internal medicine patients. Methods Open label, 2 consecutive periods of one month, prospective study, conducted on patients admitted for more than 48 h in 7 internal medicine wards in a university hospital. In period 1, patients were treated with usual care (control group). In period 2, patients were treated with usual care preceded by a medication review performed by chief residents within 24 h after admission using PIM-Check© electronic application (intervention group). At 48 h, all medications, lab results, comorbidities and active diagnosis were collected for each patient. DRPs were identified by a ''gold standard'' group, composed of a clinical pharmacist, a clinical pharmacologist and two attending-physicians of internal medicine analysing all patientsdataset (blinded to period group). Results Two hundred ninety-seven patients were included: 188 in control group and 109 in intervention group. A total of 909 DRPs (mean/ patient ± SD: 3.1 ± 2.2) were identified: 3.2 ± 2.2 in control group and 2.9 ± 2.2 in intervention group (P-value 0.21). Both groups were comparable (age, sex, number of drugs, co-morbidities) and had similar mean of DRPs/ patients. Top 5 active compound involved in DRPs were: esomeprazole, paracetamol, tobacco, aspirin and thiamine. In the intervention group, the mean number of statements suggested by PIM-Check© was 13.9 ± 7/patients. Among the 311 DRPs identified in this group, 33.4% (n = 104) were suggested by PIM-Check©, but no treatment modification were performed. Discussion and conclusions PIM-Check© allowed identifying one third of DRPs approved by a gold standard group. However, the number of DRPs did not decrease in the intervention group when physicians used PIM-Check ©. The high number of statements displayed by the electronic application, and the hesitancy of hospital physicians to change treatment associated with chronic medical conditions, especially in the first 48 h of hospitalization may explain the lack of impact on the number of DRPs.

As part of CRIT, rising chiefs agree to develop and implement an Action Plan (AP), an educational product designed to teach geriatrics principles to residents and/or students. Despite CRIT's success, there have been no formal assessments to what extent chiefs achieve their APs. DESCRIPTION: In 2010, UMMS held its inaugural 3-day CRIT with 13 rising chiefs - general surgery (3); neurology (3); orthopedics (2); internal medicine (IM) (2); family medicine (1); psychiatry (1); and ob-gyn (1). Three residency program directors (PDs) attended. All 13 chiefs agreed to complete an AP and met with two UMMS geriatrics faculty during CRIT for planning and implementation. Chiefs were asked to identify a geriatrician faculty mentor for their designated AP. EVALUATION: Six months post-CRIT, chiefs were asked to complete a post-CRIT survey, reporting their AP completion status (0-100%). RESULTS: Survey response rate was 84.6% (11/13) - with 2 chiefs lost to follow up (ob-gyn, neurology). See table for details. Examples of completed APs included - an IM resident created a lecture on diabetic management in older patients delivered monthly as part of a new ambulatory primary care curriculum; an ortho resident developed and implemented a set of mutually agreed upon rules of engagement for IM and ortho residents and IM hospitalists to improve coordination of care of hip fracture patients. CONCLUSIONS: Rising chief residents proposed a wide variety of APs in association with the CRIT program, but had varied success regarding the extent to which they achieved the AP by 6 months.

Our goal is to begin to transform CRIT into a robust interprofessional education (IPE) experience for rising chiefs. DESCRIPTION: In May 2012, UMMS developed and implemented a major CRIT curricular IPE pilot, enhancing the original curriculum by: 1) Incorporating transitions of care principles into one small group session by adding a readmission scenario; 2) Developing a new collaborative mini-lecture on transitions of care that offered the perspective of a geriatrician, two advanced nurse practitioners, and a nurse case manager; 3) Collaborating with the participating PharmD to develop a pilot delirium mini-lecture from a pharmacist's perspective. EVALUATION: UMMS CRIT chiefs were asked to complete baseline, post-surveys, and six month post-surveys. RESULTS: Post-survey response rate was 100% (19/19) and six month response rate was was 94.7% (18/19). Only 27.7% (5/18) had taught about the value of a collaborative, interprofessional team process in the six months preceding CRIT. Following CRIT, 78.9% (15/19) rising chiefs strongly agreed that CRIT increased their appreciation of the value of an interdisciplinary team when managing older patients (see Table 1 for more details). Six months later, 100% (19/19) of rising chiefs agreed/strongly agreed that CRIT increased their understanding of the components of a safe discharge plan for adults. CONCLUSION: UMMS' CRIT IPE pilot heightened the appreciation of rising chief residents for the importance of working in patient-centered, interprofessional teams in caring for complex older adults.

I. and Stoll, D. A. and Richardson, J. D. and Britt, L. D. and Members of the Residency Review, Committee-Surgery",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16105514,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The Residency Review Committee-Surgery (RRC--S), 1 of 10 surgical specialties of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has monitored the surgical volume of all general surgical residents closely. As a consequence of the reduction of duty hours with the limitation of an 80-hour work-week (averaged over 4 weeks), we were interested in the impact of these restrictions on surgical (volume) experience since its first year of implementation (2003--2004). Therefore, we evaluated the surgical volume of general surgical services since the implementation of the ACGME duty-hour restrictions and compared this volume with that of previous years without these duty limits. METHODS: The Biostatistical Management Section of the ACGME implemented prospective analysis of categorized data for total surgical procedures and Chief Resident cases. The study interval included all resident surgical procedures completed from 1997 to 2004. We were interested particularly in evaluating trends and outcomes after the first year of successful full compliance of the 80-hour work week. Specific evaluations included the impact on surgical programs for total major procedures and Chief Resident cases requisite for application to the American Board of Surgery. RESULTS: The average number of total major procedures for both resident and program averages were noted to increase steadily through the academic years of evaluation (1997--2001). A sharp decrease was evident in the total major procedures for the academic year 2001--2002 that relates to a correction of the biostatistical database implemented by the ACGME to correct a system conversion that began in the academic year 2001--2002. Despite significant changes to the system data mappings, beginning in the academic year 2001, this reduction is explained by the total counted surgeries as major that were eliminated in a revised counting methodology. It was evident on evaluation of the average (of averages) for major surgical procedures per resident (per program) in academic years 1997 to 2004 that the number of procedures was not statistically different in the academic years evaluated when compared with the year for implementation of duty-hour standards (2003--2004). Data analysis further indicates that the average procedures (per resident) performed as Chief Resident in general surgery remained stable from 1997 to 2004; the use of tiered t tests comparing Chief Resident averages (per program) for the academic years 2002--2003 versus 2003--2004 indicated that data remained consistent and confirmed no statistical variance in volumes during this interval (P=0.43). Because some general surgery programs have exceptions for duty-hour requirements (n=15) to allow an 88-hour week averaged over 4 weeks, these differences were of interest to evaluate programs with and without these duty-hour exceptions. Preliminary data with these limited parameters of evaluation suggest no detrimental outcomes related to the duty-hour restrictions for total major procedures per resident or for surgical procedures as Chief Residents for programs with and without these approved exceptions. CONCLUSIONS: RRCs that evaluate general surgery and surgical specialties have responded aggressively and professionally to implement the duty-hour standards per the ACGME. This brief report should be considered an interim communication to evaluate the surgical experience impact for programs currently under the restriction of duty-hour limits. The data provided in the first year of evaluation since the implementation of the 80-hour work-week restriction policy suggest that there has been no significant change in the overall surgical experience for major procedures (per resident), nor has there been a negative impact on Chief Resident surgical experience. A continuum of the prospective evaluation process is required by the RRC-S and other surgical specialties to ensure that requisite surgical volume is maintained throughout the entire 5 years of clinical surgery.","Bland, Kirby I     Stoll, Doris A     Richardson, J David     Britt, L D     eng     Editorial     Evaluation Studies     Am J Surg. 2005 Sep;190(3):345-50. doi: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2005.06.036.

Objectives: We designed and implemented a multi-modal curriculum during a conference to augment conference programming. Our goals included: to help identify areas of interest, exposure to scholarly inquiry, and to encourage development of meaningful and feasible scholarly projects. Curricular Design: Residents were required to attend 1-2 sessions daily pre-selected by the curricular design team due to relevance for resident research as well as attend at least two selfselected sessions per day. Two 75-minute daily debriefs were held after conference days. Each session began with a brief presentation by a faculty member followed by small group discussions (led by a chief resident and an assistant program director) and finished with reportage. Day 1's presentation was Research Experiences as a Resident: Identifying Opportunities followed by small group discussions focused on I Wish I Had Thought of That (easy to conduct research with potentially high-impact results) and Cool Idea but Could Have Been Done Better (research on important issues in EM but with methodologic flaws). Day 2's presentation was Pursuing Research Training to Enhance an EM Career followed by small groups where individuals shared ideas and culminated with residents reporting on the project ideas of others to the larger group.

A.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000209142900425,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Switzerland is a multicultural country with a growing immigrant population. Around one third of Lausanne University Hospital patients are not Swiss citizens and part of them - asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, foreign-language speaking residents - are characterized by a poor access to care and health status. Improving the ability of the providers to address linguistic and cultural barriers is a key issue for Swiss healthcare institutions. Within a national initiative encouraging centers of competences in cross-cultural care, Lausanne University Hospital assessed the distribution of cross-cultural competences between the hospital departments as well as between medical doctors and nurses. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was used to explore 1) expert resources (knowledge, access), 2) education (access, self-perceived preparedness), 3) practices (specific issues, self-assessed skillfulness) and 4) opinions (hospital policy) regarding care of immigrants patients. The questionnaire consisted of 64 items, some of which were adapted from a US validated scale, whereas others were derived from a similar survey conducted at Geneva University Hospital. A mail survey was sent in November 2010 to every resident, chief resident and nurse of a sample of 11 hospital departments : the 5 departments with at least one internal crosscultural resource (clinical team or training program) and 6 departments chosen randomly within the departments without such resources. The first group of departments (primary care, psychiatry, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency room) was categorized as sensitized to cross-cultural care, the second group (internal medicine, neurology, rheumatology, urology, radiooncology) as non sensitized. RESULTS: A total of 371 out of 885 eligible healthcare providers participated (response rate 41.2%). Respondents included 59.7% of healthcare providers from sensitized departments and 33.6% of medical doctors. Healthcare providers from sensitized departments had a significantly better knowledge and access to the hospital expert resources than providers from non-sensitized departments, they attended more crosscultural trainings and rated themselves more prepared to care for culturally diverse populations. Medical doctors had a significantly better knowledge and access to the expert resources than nurses, they attended more trainings and rated themselves more competent at most intercultural tasks. However no statistically significant difference of opinion appeared regarding the hospital diversity policy, neither between departments nor between professions : the necessity for hospitals to adapt to linguistic barriers (speaking or writing) was fairly accepted (66.4% and 71.9%) while the necessity to adapt to cultural barriers was poorly accepted (16.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a remarkable homogeneity of opinions regarding hospital diversity management, cross-cultural competencies appear to be unequally distributed among hospital departments and between medical doctors and nurses. Addressing diversity is a challenge that must not be limited to part of the medical specialties nor to part of the healthcare professions. In parallel to the development of expert resources in specific departments, hospitals have to make sure that cross-cultural care is integrated in every nurse's and physician's education cursus and that expert resources are known and available for every provider in all medical departments.","Suppl. 2     V35ig     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Background: There is a dearth of existing educational resources that pictorially contrast normal age-related anatomic and histologic organ system changes. Most available resources demonstrate normal versus pathologic. Methods: Pivotal to Image Atlas completion was developing partnerships with the UMMS Pathology Department and UMMS Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology. UMMS' Advancing Geriatrics Education (AGE)/Reynolds summer student forged new working relationships with two pathology chief residents and the co-DSF course director. Drawing from existing histological and anatomic images generated by the UMMS Department of Pathology (histologic slides, culled from recent autopsies and a legacy slide collection) and the UMMS Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology (dissection images), and online textbooks, a MS2 student compiled, annotated, and produced an online module to be used by anatomy students/faculty and geriatricians. After discussions with UMMS' AGE team, the DSF course directors agreed to integrate the Image Atlas into the DSF curriculum. The Atlas served as the student prep material both for two UMMS geriatrician visits to the anatomy lab during abdominal cavity dissections and an introductory lecture given by an academic geriatrician. EVALUATION: All MS1s (n=125) will complete an end-ofcourse evaluation for DSF that will encompass the Image Atlas module. Conclusions: The Image Atlas was successfully incorporated into the existing DSF curriculum, introducing the concepts of normal aging and homeostenosis to first year medical students.

Simultaneously, there is a great need to quantify the outcomes from CAM/IM practices in order to document the effectiveness of these approaches to patients care. Summary of Work: Naturopathic Patient-Reported Outcomes in Heart Disease and Diabetes (ND-PROHD) was implemented in January 2012 in order to provide clinical research opportunities for newly created Student Research Clinicians and a Chief Resident within the naturopathic clinical training clinic of Bastyr University. This prospective, observational cohort study uses the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system coupled with mobile web browsers in order to collect patient-reported data in real time during clinical rotations. Prospective changes in quality of life, selfefficacy, self-care behaviors and mood will be collected quarterly and compared to baseline values every six months. Summary of Results: IRB approval was secured prior to implementation. As of June 2012, 4 student research clinicians have participated in the elective, i.e., two per quarter, and 31 participants had been enrolled in the study, allowing for student participation in over 75 patients interviews. of the participants enrolled, 18 (58%) were seeking care for type 2 diabetes and 11 (35%) were seeking care for hypertension. Implementation has been smoothly integrated into the flow of routine care. Interim results following the initial six months of implementation are currently under analysis. Conclusion: Creating specific clinical research electives facilitates research opportunities for CAM/IM trainees, and helps provide access to clinical research faculty for mentorship. Using existing health information technology tools, the implementation of prospective clinical research can be efficiently performed in academic CAM/IM settings, enriching student research training, and simultaneously collecting critical data on patient outcomes and quality of care from CAM/IM academic clinics.","L71183959     2013-10-11 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Completing informed consent prior to CT simulation can be difficult; we sought to improve our institution's informed consent process and rate of ASTRO-APEx consent compliance. Purpose/Objective(s): A consent committee was formed to optimize the processes around informed consent. An audit of the current state of informed consent was performed. Results of this audit were discussed and new processes established. Rates of consent were tracked after establishment of the new processes. Results: In May 2016, the committee performed an audit of the current consent process and recognized that only 44% of patients signed consent at the time of consultation, 47% of patients signed consent on the day of simulation, and 9% of patients signed consent after simulation. We deemed best practice as capturing the consent at the time of consultation. The radiation oncology department set a goal of 80% of patients to sign informed consent at the time of consultation. In order to reach the goal of 80%, the committee created several solutions that would be rolled out as tests of change. The tests of change included updates to all consent forms and to have updated copies available in the patient examination rooms and the MD workrooms. Additionally, since the Resident physician was the primary person to capture the consent, Resident education on the consent process was implemented. Follow up education was provided by the Chief Resident once a month at chart rounds until compliance rates were above 85% at consultation. These solutions were rolled out over a 3 month period, with monthly check-ins by the committee. Additionally, the committee continued to track when informed consent was captured, and at the end of the three months, the consents were being collected 70-75% at the time of consultation. Conclusion: Informed consent is an integral part of the doctor-patient relationship and the radiation therapy treatment process. Establishing processes to ensure this occurs in a consistent, accurate and timely manner results in better informed patients and improved workflow that is consistent with ASTRO-APEx accreditation.","Suppl.

Whether quality can be maintained in practices with large patient volumes incorporating resident education is unknown. We sought to determine the neurosurgical oncology practice patterns and perioperative outcomes in our own very large academic quaternary referral setting and the impact of resident education on patient outcome. METHODS: Outcomes for adult patients undergoing neurosurgery for cranial tumors between 2009 and 2013 were reviewed. Neurological, regional, and systemic complications and mortality were recorded as well as whether the case was performed primarily by a staff or chief resident service with the assumption that the latter had more autonomy. Data was correlated using additional quality metrics available through the NSQIP database. RESULTS: A total of 5022 adult cranial tumor procedures were performed at our institution in this 5 year period. These included 1092 craniotomies for intraaxial tumors, 573 craniotomies for extraaxial, non-skull base tumors, 608 craniotomies for skull base tumors, 770 transsphenoidal procedures for pituitary or sellar tumors, 467 stereotactic biopsies, and 1511 radiosurgery procedures. Most patients (n=4541; 90.4%) had no complications. Temporary neurological deficits were seen in 279 (5.6%), permanent deficits in 111 (2.2%), and seizures in 27 (0.5%). Regional and medical complications each occurred in 70 patients (1.4%). Perioperative mortality occurred in 19 patients (0.4%). Skull base procedures and stereotactic biopsies accounted for 6 (31.6%) and 7 (36.8%) of the 19 mortalities, respectively. Patient outcomes were independent of resident participation. This is despite the fact that patients treated by chief residents are older, had higher comorbidities and were more likely to undergo emergent procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity and mortality rates are low and compare favorably to other published series. These data suggest that excellent outcomes for adult cranial tumor can be maintained in high volume clinical practices without sacrificing commitment to resident education.","Suppl. 6     Er2dk     Surg-22     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

E. and Formanek, P. and Worsham, C. M. and Swamy, L. and Shanawani, H.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000400372502596,English,,,"Rationale: Despite increased awareness of QI, both cost of care and outcome disparities have continued to increase since the release of the Institute of Medicine' s landmark To Err is Human report in 1999. Recent data from the ACGME suggest that current medical trainees have limited knowledge of QI concepts, methods, and approaches. Data from pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) program directors (PDs) suggest that less than half of graduates are capable of independent QI. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) developed the CRQS program for the express purpose of infusing quality and patient safety education into medical training while simultaneously developing physician-leaders in the field. Since 2009, the program has graduated 163 CRQSs. Currently there are 84 CRQS positions at 57 VA Medical Centers. This study reviews the shared curricular experiences of physicians uniquely prepared to accelerate integration of QI education. Methods: A workgroup of five CRQSs with career interests in PCCM convened on September 22, 2016 at the annual Quality and Patient Safety Institute held in Indianapolis, IN to discuss the substantial challenges PCCM PDs face in integrating QI education into fellowship training. Workgroup members discussed common curricular elements and their relevance to QI and PCCM training. Three authors (WB, MC, and PF) manually extracted activity data from end-of-year summaries for all CRQSs (N = 29) from academic year 2013. Results: Identified elements included formal lectures, virtual discussions, conferences, extra-curricular training, experiential learning, QI teaching, and mentorship. CRQSs receive monthly, one-hour, interactive, virtual lectures and attend a five-day immersive conference covering The Model for Improvement, lean methodology, human factors engineering, statistical analysis, and QI curriculum development. Monthly conferences are followed by longer, virtual discussion sessions around the previous lecture topic and on-going QI projects. All receive at least 76 hours of formal QI training. Most engage in additional training with an average of 4.5 (SD = 1.2) formal QI training activities. Similarly, on average, participants engage in 6.1 (SD = 2.5) experiential learning projects and 5.8 (SD = 2.8) resident/faculty QI teaching activities. Both local and national QI mentors directly facilitate each CRQS's progress. Conclusions: PCCM fellowship programs with VA-affiliation have access to motivated physicians undergoing unique training toward expertise in both the practice and teaching of QI. CRQSs can provide the fellow/faculty didactics, expert project consultation, and project supervision/continuity frequently identified as inhibiting integration of QI training in PCCM fellowships.","Et6ak     A3280     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

As a grantee of ADGAP's CRIT? program, we needed such a tool as an Opening Program for our 2013 presentation. (?CRIT - Chief Residents' Immersion Training, developed at Boston University and administered by ADGAP). One of our authors is very familiar with auctions, and knowing that they can be highly interactive, suggested that we could open our program (now called GRIT) with an auction of elder-care items. We expanded the concept into a teaching tool by assigning points to items and scoring participants on whether they purchased (with play money) items which are clearly beneficial for the elderly, such as nightlights or Advance Directives, vs those which are not so useful and may be detrimental, such as copper bracelets and cancer insurance. Feedback from the first presentation showed that the Auction was engaging and popular, and a pilot study was undertaken to see if educational benefits could be demonstrated. Results: Four groups of third year medical students on their Internal Medicine rotations were included, 2 experienced the auction and 2 did not. Each group was surveyed before and after their rotation with a questionnaire inquiring about their general attitudes toward geriatrics and the elderly (Attitude), and about factual geriatric information conveyed during the auction (Knowledge). -The no-auction group showed no change in either Knowledge (p=0.391) or Attitude (p=0.361) pre- to post- rotation. -The auction group had a statistically significant increase in Knowledge (p=0.003) and no change in Attitude (p=0.588). -Comparison of the auction vs no-auction groups' post rotation results also supported that the auction groups had significant improvement in retained Knowledge (p=0.002) at the end of the rotation vs those who did not experience the auction. Conclusions: This very small pilot study shows promising results in improvement of geriatric knowledge by use of this innovative and fun activity. Presentations of the Aging Auction to other groups have been very well received, albeit not yet studied, as an activity to engage larger groups. We believe it can be further developed into a tool which, with modifications, can be used in a variety of settings to improve both Knowledge and Attitudes. We speculate that it may be maximally effective in interprofessional groups, and with larger groups than were in the clerkships.","Suppl. 1 Sp. Iss.

This impacts care, as depressed residents make more medical errors. However, best practices for fostering resident wellness and screening for and managing burnout and depression are inadequately described. METHODS: Developing Resident Emotional and Mental Health (DREAM) is a chief resident-led program to coordinate residency-wide efforts to promote wellness and reduce rates of burnout and depression. A resident wellness committee guides selection and implementation of interventions and oversees evaluation. DREAM focuses on: 1) fostering innovative, complementary curricula aimed at improving wellness; and 2) implementing a mental health screening program. Screening aims to: quantify and trend rates of burnout and depression; create opportunities for residents to self-identify burnout and depression; and quickly and confidentially link residents to support. Periodic screening will occur via an optional survey with questions from the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Results will be de-identified to the program but reviewed by the hospital's independent Office of Clinician Support (OCS), who will contact residents screening positive. OCS will offer in-person appointments, support from chiefs and peer supporters, and additional resources. RESULTS: In the first year, DREAM mapped existing efforts in the domains of supportive program components, assessment, wellness education, and mental health intervention. We identified gaps where innovation is needed and started to 1) enhance existing curricula; 2) establish wellness half-days, a peer support program, and a personal story sharing program; and 3) raise awareness about existing mental health services. Screening will begin in February 2017, after which rates of burnout and depression will be trended. CONCLUSIONS: By implementing DREAM, we increased resident self-awareness of mental health issues. Next steps include measuring the effectiveness of our interventions to achieve decreased rates of burnout and depression.","L617343474     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Because prevalence is low, some pediatrics residents finish training having little to no clinical experience managing acute complications. Infrequent clinical encounters coupled with the inherently complicated nature of SCD have contributed to knowledge and training gaps. Pediatrics residents need opportunities for clinical experience managing acute complications of SCD. The purpose of this study was to develop simulation exercises and associated scoring methods and determine whether these scenarios could be used to evaluate acute SCD exacerbation care skills. Methods Used: Scenarios were created from actual patient cases and followed the American Board of Pediatrics and ACGME content outlines. Participants individually managed seven simulation scenarios: Vaso-Occlusive Pain Crisis, Acute Chest Syndrome, Ceftriaxone-induced Hemolytic Anemia (CIHA), Asthma Exacerbation, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), Acute Splenic Sequestration Crisis, andWrist Pain. Participants were required to make diagnostic and treatment interventions within a 5-minute period. Two raters scored recorded performances using a checklist of key diagnostic & therapeutic actions and global evaluations (1-poor to 9-superior). Summary of Results: The assessment cohort included 16 interns, 5 PGY-2, 2 PGY-3, 2 chief residents, and 3 Hem/Onc fellows. Asthma exacerbation was the scenario most proficiently managed (mean checklist score= 77%, SD 12.9); PRES proved most challenging (mean checklist score= 46.1%, SD 12.8). Mean global scores ranged from 4.1 on CIHA and PRES to 6.4 for asthma exacerbation. Checklist scoring had strong interrater reliability (0.73 - 0.93); global evaluations varied widely (0.46 - 0.84). Conclusions: This is the first study using mannequin-based simulation to teach and assess pediatrics resident skills in the acute management of a single disease process. The model proved valid for differentiating skills of more experienced pediatrics trainees from those early in training. It provided a reliable evaluation of a participant's ability to recognize and respond to simulated acute exacerbations of SCD.","869xv     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

M.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15265348,,,,"Palliative medicine, in many ways, deserves merit for bringing alive and keeping alive the core reason why many of us pursued this profession in the first place. In many ways, palliative medicine is really 'feel good' medicine. We strive to make our patients 'feel good' by focusing on quality of life and we 'feel good' doing it. However, in the age of evidence-based medicine, palliative medicine, must combine 'feeling good' with data that our interventions actually work. As a chief resident, I wanted to begin to collect the data needed to show that palliative care made a difference. I became familiar with an antinausea agent called ABHR cream and became interested in studying it. The so-called ABHR cream contains lorazapem (Ativan, Wyeth Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA), diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Pfizer, New York, NY), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho- McNeil-Pharmaceutical, Raritan, NJ) and metoclopromide (Reglan, Wyeth Laboratories) compounded in a pluronic lethicin organo-gel (PLO) and applied transdermally to treat nausea. ABHR cream is in common use at hospices across the country and the four ingredients are medications, known to be safe and effective when given orally, intravenously and some even rectally. Anecdotal evidence supports its use; one local hospice used this as their first line treatment of nausea. Outside of hospice, the agent is unheard of. An exhaustive search via the standard medical, nursing and pharmacy search engines turned up few references. None provided data on the use of ABHR cream in humans. The disparity struck me. Either this drug is a brilliant unrecognized addition to antiemetics or hospice patients receive an expensive placebo. I went to my mentor and proposed a clinical trial of AHBR cream. Four years later, without a single patient enrolled, we realized our naivete. By reporting our experience, we hope to highlight some of obstacles in doing research in palliative care and to initiate a discussion on how to overcome them.

These meetings often lack a structured curriculum to teach the theories, principles, and tools of QPI. Proposed changes to common program requirements for surgical residents require QPI project experience. Furthermore, knowledge of QPI concepts is vital to a successful surgical practice. We developed a pilot QPI curriculum for our residents to determine feasibility. METHODS: A 1-year curriculum was developed with the guidance of our institution's QPI team. This curriculum consisted of a series of 15-minute lectures from the PI team, held monthly. These lectures were followed by 30 minutes of group project time. Six groups were created, led by a chief resident and with members from each post-graduate year. Each group identified an opportunity for improvement within our institution and used tools from the lectures to work through the QPI process. Group presentations were held in months 2, 8, and 11. RESULTS: Residents in our program were involved in our QPI curriculum and a QPI group project. The tools and methods taught by by the PI instructors were immediately reinforced via group projects and demonstrated in the group presentations. There were no major barriers to curriculum development or implementation. CONCLUSIONS: A structured QPI curriculum is feasible and is an important asset to a surgical residency. Educating residents on QPI concepts, while simultaneously reinforcing those skills in group projects, provides a solid foundation for residents to develop the skillsets needed for future practice.","Suppl. 2     Fk2nq     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

One common diagnosis is ischemic optic neuropathy due to the excessive increase of intraocular pressure (IOP) during procedure. Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) needs patients are positioned on operating table tilted about 30-35 degrees (steel Trendelenburg) and the pneumoperitoneum pressure is about 13 mmHg; those factors lead to IOP increase. In addition volatile or intravenous anesthetics contribute to increase IOP. Anesthesiologist has to provide adequate control of IOP. Materials & Methods: We performed a prospective, randomized study to compare the effects of volatile versus intravenous anesthetics on IOP increasing during RALP. After approval by our local Ethics Committee and written informed consent, IOP was measured using OBF Langham System tonometer in ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing elective RALP. 40 patients were randomized in two groups: group B received balanced anesthesia with volatile anesthetics, group T received total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. Exclusion criteria were adverse reactions to any of the anesthetic agents used in the study and ophthalmic disease. The IOP was measured before anesthesia while supine and awake (baseline T0), anesthetized and supine after induction (T1), anesthetized after insufflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide (CO2) in steep Trendelenburg at the beginning (T2) and at the end of the surgery (T3), finally anesthetized supine before awakening (T4 ). All measurements were performed by the same ophthalmology chief resident. The primary end point of our study was to investigate any differences in IOP of patients underwent balanced versus total intravenous anesthesia. Results: Baseline IOP (T0) was 18,8±1,7 mmHg in Group T and 18,7±1,6 mmHg in Group B. IOP decreased to a minimum of 12,2±3,1 mmHg after induction (T1) in Group T and to 13,2±4 mmHg in Group B (p=NS). At time point T2 IOP was 25,4±3,8 in Group T, significantly lower than in Group B, 30,2±6,2 (p=0,0151). At the end of the surgery (T3) IOP was lower in Group T, 29.9±3 than is Group B, 34,2±4,3 (p=0,0042). At T4 IOP decreases to 21,8±3,5 in Group T and 22,8±4,9 in Group B (p=NS). Conclusions: During RALP IOP reaches levels that are comparable with those observed in glaucoma patients in both of the groups. Our results demonstrate that the increase of IOP was more pronounced and sustained in the balanced anaesthesia as compared with total intravenous anesthesia. IOP increase may not be of any consequence in the majority of patients undergoing RALP, but it may be harmful in patients with glaucoma. We conclude that total intravenous anesthesia is the safer anesthetic regimen during RALP, especially in patients at risk.","739kh     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

We report the development of a leadership program to prepare residents to be effective in leadership roles early in their careers. Design: Partnering with Health System leaders, we held focus groups with residents and faculty and then surveyed both groups on 15 recognized competencies for health care leadership to determine which were felt to be most important to learn during residency. We used the results of the survey to design our curriculum. Results: We identified 9 competencies from the survey to include in the program and they fell into 5 broad categories of leadership skills: Leading, Standards and Accountability, Planning and Decision Making, Communication and Managing Relationships. Using external consultants and internal experts, we designed a program with workshops, lectures, panels, focus groups, and one-on-one sessions. Unique features of the workshops were training videos we developed and used as examples of best and worst practices. These videos were also used in teaching programs outside of Pathology, since the leadership skills were easily translatable. The Chair is actively involved and offers informal monthly 1 on 1 mentoring sessions, discussions with all residents and additional sessions for Chief Residents. We also meet with residents regularly to assess understanding and utilization of these skills. We are in our third year of program development and after introducing several topics the first year, we decided to highlight one major leadership topic a year interspersed with continuing education of 'core' skills building sessions for new residents and faculty. The initial highlighted topics were emotional intelligence, personal branding and communicating effectively. The focus for the next few years will be building and strengthening relationships and personal accountability.

At Baystate Medical Center, a new palliative care consult service was underutilized in part due to uncertainty about the distinction between hospice and palliative care. An interactive case-based teaching module was developed to address this challenge in a project launched by a medical resident after attending a Chief Resident Immersion Training program in geriatrics. The goal was to help residents define the differences between hospice and palliative care through discussion and analysis of an unfolding case. Methods A 1-hour noon conference for internal medicine residents was developed containing two parts: the first defined the differences between hospice and palliative care through a buzz word activity and the second applied these differences to an unfolding case. Buzz word activity: Groups of 4 residents generated a list of descriptors for hospice and palliative care. These were recorded on a Venn diagram to help differentiate features of the two services. Residents were asked to reason why they would categorize each descriptor as hospice versus palliative care and considered whether a given descriptor could apply to both services. Unfolding case: Discussion further emphasized the differences between the two services and prompted residents to consider additional history and other necessary strategies to determine the most appropriate service for a given stage of disease. Pre/post-test questions were written by a team of geriatricians and internists to measure effectiveness of the educational intervention. Results and Conclusions 20 internal medical residents participated in the conference. Mean score of the pre-test was 68% and of the post-test was 78%. Residents expressed greater confidence in understanding the indications for appropriate referrals. Subsequently, the palliative care team and hospice nurses reported greater awareness, utilization and understanding among the participants in this teaching module. As internal medicine physicians care for an ever-expanding elderly population, it is important for residents to gain confidence and proficiency in caring for patients at the end of life2.","Suppl. 1 Sp.

It is imperative that non-geriatricians acquire skills and knowledge to ensure coordinated care. The two-day Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) Program in the Care of Older Adults at Boston Medical Center (BMC) is an educational intervention for Chief Residents (CRs). CRIT goals are to: 1) provide concentrated training in geriatrics principles to CRs in medical and surgical disciplines; 2) foster institutional collaboration among disciplines to improve the coordination and quality of care; and 3) develop CR teaching and leadership skills with a focus on the care of complex older adult patients. It is the model for a national dissemination. METHODS: The curriculum includes an interactive surgical case, didactics on geriatrics topics, seminars to enhance teaching/ leadership skills, and 1-to-1 mentoring to help CRs develop a geriatrics care or education project. For this analysis, we examined baseline and 6-month self-report surveys for 96 CRs from 16 different specialties at BMC who attended model CRIT from 2008-2012. RESULTS: The baseline response rate was 99%, and at 6 months was 84.4%. CRs reported increased confidence in their ability to apply clinical problem solving skills to the care of older patients, sense of responsibility for teaching others about geriatrics issues, and extent to which others viewed them as a resource in geriatrics (all p<.001). CRs showed significant improvements in confidence related to four leadership skills and overall leadership required to carry out work as CRs (all p<.001). CONCLUSIONS:Now in its 10th year, the model CRIT continues to show robust and sustained increases in self-reported confidence to teach geriatrics and enhanced skills needed for the role of CR. CRIT has expanded beyond BMC, and has been successfully replicated at 33 medical institutions nationwide with over 1000 CRs trained from 2007-2013.","Suppl. 1 Sp. Iss.

METHODS: This secondary data analysis comes from a broader survey on cross-cultural care at Lausanne University Hospital andDepartment of ambulatory care and community medicine. A 64-item questionnaire, including translated/ back-translated items from the validated survey, Residency training in crosscultural care, was mailed in November 2010 to residents, chief residents and nurses. Preparedness items asked How prepared do you feel to care for...? referring to patient-profiles, such as patients with distrust of the health care system on an ascending 5-point Likert scale. We examined proportions of 4- well/5-very well prepared, and the mean composite score for the eight items.We used simple and multivariate linear regression to examine the effect of the following variables on the composite: demographics (gender, non-French dominant language), work (provider role, time at institution, work-unit sensitized to cultural-care), and items on reported cultural-competence training, and cross-cultural care problem-awareness.We determinedwhich were significant before and after adjustment. We present results significant at the p=0.05 level. RESULTS: Of 885 mailed questionnaires, 371 individuals (41.2 %) returned the completed survey: 123 (33.6 %) physicians and 239 (66.4 %) nurses, reflecting the distribution of providers in the institution. The mean composite score was 3.30 (SD 0.70) with the highest proportion of well/ very well-prepared responses for the item referring to patients with cultures different from your own (67.2 %) and the lowest for whose religious beliefs affect treatment (21.9 %). Prior to adjustment, having a non-French dominant language (p=0.004), working in a sensitized department (p=0.003), five of eight training experience items and four of six problem-awareness items were significantly correlated with higher preparedness. After multivariate adjustment, having a non-French dominant language (?=0.25, p=.012), working in a sensitized department (?=0.21, p=.007), having received training on the history/culture of a specific group (?=0.25, p=.03) remained significantly associated; as did problemawareness about the lack of practical experience caring for diverse populations (?=0.25, p=.004) and about inadequate cross-cultural training (?=0.18, p=.04). Nurse provider role (?=0.221, p=.03) was also associated with higher preparedness, after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Self-assessed preparedness among Lausanne providers leaves room for improvement. But, speaking a non-native dominant language, working in a sensitized department, and possessing specific training experiences and problem-awareness were associated with preparedness. The positive effect of nurse role on preparedness is consistent - Swiss nurses have historically led the charge on cultural competency. These findings highlight strategies for improving provider preparedness and thus high-quality crosscultural care: emphasizing the experience of nurses, and the institution's role in creating a diverse and culturally sensitive work environment.","Suppl. 1     Ab6zp     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

A. and Richardson, J. D. and Polk, H. C.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000221023600010,English,,,"Back-ground Data: Our program has emphasized broad-based training that potentially allows residents to pursue a variety of career paths, with or without additional surgical training. Diverse experiences have emphasized a variety of rotations, including a university hospital with a large trauma service, several tertiary private institutions, and suburban and rural experiences with private practitioners. Our faculty includes Surgeons with both broad-based and narrowly focused practices. In light of duty-hour restrictions and proposed changes in surgical training, we assessed the results Of this model over an extended period.     Materials and Methods: The case volume from the Residency Review Committee (RRC) operative logs, ABSITE scores, ABS performance. fellowship training, and subsequent career choices were examined for all graduating chief residents in general surgery from our program over the past 17 years. The impact of specialty faculty was assessed and data from 5 index (aortic, major esopha-gogastric, liver. pancreatic, and pelvic resections) cases were also abstracted front the logs. A survey was then sent to all 208 of the 212 surgeons who had completed the program since 1971.     Results: Of the 115 residents who completed training in the last 17 years, 60 pursued fellowship training and 55 went directly into general surgical practice in 20 states. Fifteen of the 29 residents who had an elective laboratory experience were among the 23 who remained in academic careers. The operative experience has been excellent (1090 42 total major, 240 +/- 21 surgeon chief). Experience did not vary. even though the number of graduating chiefs ranged from 5 to 8 per year. and there have been no deficiencies in RRC index cases. The addition of specialty faculty (n = 5) at various intervals promptly increased the volume of complex cases in pelvic, liver, pancreas, and vascular surgery. Since all residents promptly passed the ABS examinations, it was not possible to discern factors associated with Board performances other than broad-based training. The survey demonstrated that most continued to practice broad-based general surgery and believed that such training was highly relevant to their current practice.     Conclusions: The provision of broad-based training with generalists and specialty faculty has allowed for excellent breadth and depth in case volume. While many residents pursued fellowships, those who did not have indeed achieved successful careers. Most Continue to practice general surgery, indicating the value of complete training in this field. It will be important to monitor these outcomes as changes in residency training occur.","815ds     Times Cited:29     Cited References Count:25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The purpose of this study is to explore resident perceived levels of proficiency and understand their training experiences. METHODS: An anonymous online 15-question survey was sent to all program coordinators of accredited United States Ob/Gyn residency programs through the APGO program coordinator listserv. The program coordinators then distributed the survey to their graduating residents. RESULTS: Of the 174 chief residents who initiated the survey, 148 (85%) completed the survey. The majority (78%) planned to pursue general practice. Less than half felt ""very confident"" performing advanced minimally invasive procedures independently: laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy (50%), total or laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (42%), laparoscopic myomectomy (11%), robotic-assisted laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy (17%), and robotic-assisted laparoscopic total hysterectomy (25%). In contrast, more participants felt ""very confident"" performing open subtotal and total hysterectomy, 71% and 76%, respectively. While 80% reported having simulation training, the simulation experience was heterogeneous: laparoscopic box trainers (87%), virtual laparoscopic trainers (43%), animal labs (39%), robotic surgery trainers (70%), vaginal hysterectomy trainers (10%). The majority felt that simulation training improved their surgical skills (85.1%) and wished to participate in more simulation (73%). CONCLUSION: Graduating Ob/Gyn residents are less confident independently performing advanced minimally invasive gynecologic procedures. Although the majority felt that simulation enhanced their skills, the extent of simulation training varied across programs. Future studies should focus on developing a uniform and comprehensive surgical simulation curriculum across all residency programs.","L613313215     2016-11-24 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Three residents are selected (generally a resident on an outpatient, consult or research block that has not previously joined) from each PGY class. The setting is a small meeting room located on campus, done during the noon hour. Selected residents are excused from noon conference and receive credit for attendance. DESCRIPTION: At our academic internal medicine residency previously, there had not been any formal setting to address perceived medical errors amongst residents, nor education on the emotional impact or coping strategies. Thus, as part of our (also new) Wellness Committee, debriefing sessions were created in an attempt to improve overall wellness amongst residents. We aimed to create a safe space and open discussion about perceived errors (avoiding root cause analysis approach), remove stigma from discussing it, share coping strategies, and provide available resources if further help is necessary (e.g., counseling services, psychiatric, etc.). These sessions occur each month. These sessions are also part of a Quality Improvement (QI) project (of chief resident and resident) with these aims: 1) To obtain baseline information regarding resident experience with medical errors/adverse outcomes and assess resident knowledge of coping strategies and resources. 2) To assess the utility of a debriefing session with fellow residents and chief/attending facilitator. EVALUATION: As part of the QI component, one-page surveys were distributed before and after each session. Pre-surveys elicited resident experience with perceived errors, knowledge of coping strategies, and comfort level with discussion and coping. Questions in the post-survey elicited the utility of session and had the same scaled questions of comfort level of discussion and coping. At this time, only several sessions have occurred, so post-intervention analysis has not been thoroughly been studied yet. This will be done after 6 sessions. However, verbal feedback and preliminary review of the surveys show that these sessions are well-received and beneficial. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: We recognize that burnout is prevalent both nationally and in our residency. While this is multifactorial, we also recognize that the intrinsic gravity of our work can be a source of stress and burnout. We reflected that medical errors (perceived or actual) or grief from patient outcome was rarely discussed. We are hopeful that creation of these sessions cultivate a safe space for discussion and education on how to better cope and ultimately improve wellness.","Suppl. 2     Go7oj     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

J.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:A1996UX39400031,English,,,"The project committee's overall findings are that even when they are as academically productive, women remain significantly less likely than men to climb the academic ladder; the reasons women in academic medicine are not succeeding at the same pace as men involve a complex combination of isolation, cultural stereotypes, and sexism, and difficulties of combining family responsibilities with professional demands; academic medicine and the public would benefit from increasing women's leadership share at all levels; and far-reaching systemic initiatives are needed to assure these increases. Some of the pressures intensifying within academic medicine, for instance to downsize departments and to reduce expenditures, certainly add to the challenges of developing more women leaders. But opportunities are apparent as well, especially to organizations and individuals taking the long view. As competition for patients and other resources mounts, institutions best able to manage their human resources and to tap the leadership potential of women as well as men will enjoy an edge. Pressures to become more customer-focused also mean greater attention to the needs of women patients (since they outnumber men). But when women have no or only token representation on policymaking committees and boards, key perspectives will likely be missing, compromising medicine's fulfillment of its social contract as well as its excellence. The project committee directs a series of 15 recommendations to leaders of medical schools, teaching hospitals, academic medical societies, and the AAMC. Under the first major area - developing and mentoring women faculty, administrators, residents and students - the committee recommends the addition of temporal flexibility to faculty policies, provision of job search assistance to partners of candidates for major positions, and design of leadership development programs, including workshops targeted at chief residents. The second major area - improving pathways to leadership - recommends garnering the perspectives of major search firm heads and current women chairs on improvements to be sought, offering guidance to search committees regarding evaluation of nontraditional candidates, and helping department chairs improve their faculty development skills. The final area - fostering readiness to change - urges medical centers to conduct self- assessments of organizational climate, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) to examine schools' experience in promoting women faculty, and the AAMC to integrate the work espoused here into its on-going programs and planning. An implementation sub-committee will issue reports highlighting 'best practices' and problem areas.","Ux394     Times Cited:4     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Data from the ACGME clinical learning environment review suggests that physicians in training have limited knowledge of QI concepts and methodology. Further, a recent survey of pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) program directors suggests <50% of PCCM graduates leave with competency to independently perform quality improvement In 2012, the Veterans Administration developed the Chief Residency in Quality and Safety (CRQS) initiative to strengthen education in the areas of quality improvement and patient safety (PS). In AY2017 there are 84 CRQS positions at 57 VA Medical Centers across the nation. This study reviews the projects undertaken by CRQSs to improve QI and PS within VA intensive care units (ICUs) over a three year period. Methods: A work group of five current Chief Residents in Quality and Patient Safety reviewed data summarizing the QI and PS activities of chief residents from AY2013, AY2014 and AY2015 to identify projects specific to critical care medicine. Projects were categorized according to clinical focus as well as whether primary intention was education/didactic versus resident-driven QI/PS Results: From 2013 to 2015, there were 141 CRQSs who described 171 QI and PS projects. Out of 171 projects reviewed, 17 (10%) were identified as resident-driven projects focusing on care in the ICU. Projects had the following goals: Improved handoffs between resident physicians (5), Goals-of-care discussions, POLST, and Advanced Directives (5), Transitions of care between ICU and acute care units (2), Out-of-OR airway management (1), Human Factors Engineering approaches to improve intubation trays (1), safety issues related to ICU mobility (1), MV liberation and SBTs (1), and improved resident education in end-tidal CO2 monitoring in the ICU (1) Conclusions: PCCM training programs with an affiliated VA and a CRQS have resources to perform resident-run QI and PS projects, including efforts to teach QI/PS and improve the care delivered in VA ICUs. CRQSs are currently directing QI and PS projects, run by residents, with direct relevance to and impact on critical care medicine and can be utilized as a resource to aide in the advancement of QI and PS in the ICU.","Et6ak     A1113     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

VATSL has also proved to be an oncologic equivalent operation to OL for early stage NSCLC. VATSL requires a high level thoracoscopic skill set with a steep learning curve. Completion of an attending level VATSL learning curve might diminish the operative experience of cardiothoracic (CT) surgery residents. Through this study we sought to compare VATSL vs. OL, during the period of moving from OL to VATSL with respect to patient outcomes, as well as measure the evolution of the CT surgery resident operative experience. Methods: This is a single institution retrospective review of a prospective thoracic surgery database. The period of transition from OL to VATSL for early stage NSCLC was 2006-2007. The initial 65 VATSL were compared to 70 OL during this time period, matched by clinical variables. The CT resident final American Board of Thoracic Surgery (ABTS) case logs for the categories Pneumonectomy, Lobectomy, Segmentectomy (PLS) and VATS were examined. Four chief residents from 2002-2005 (before initiation of the VATSL program) were compared to four chief residents from 2006-2009 (after initiation of the VATSL program). Case numbers are presented as percentages of the ABTS CT Pathway requirements for categories PLS (30 required cases) and VATS (15). Thoracic surgery residents after 2005 are provided with VATSL operative technique literature and instructional videos. Residents were taken through stepwise milestone sequences of operative VATSL techniques before supervised completion of an entire VATSL. Results were considered significant if p?0.05. Results: There were no operative deaths in either the VATSL or OL groups. Two patients in the VATSL group were converted to open secondary to intraoperative bleeding. Compared to OL the VATSL group had reduced mean days on mechanical ventilation (0.00 vs. 0.30, p = 0.03), ICU length of stay (0.20 vs. 3.70, p=0.004) and hospital length of stay (4.30 vs. 8.80, p=0.001). Examining resident education, both the 2002-2005 and 2006-2009 cohorts had similar mean case numbers for PLS (44.8 vs. 51.3, p=0.63; % of requirement 149% vs. 171%) and the 2006-2009 group performed a greater number of VATS cases (71.8 vs. 16.3, p=0.13; 478% vs. 108%). Conclusion: These results illustrate that a teaching institution can effectively move from an OL approach to VATSL and, through carefully planned and structured instruction of the residents, maintain patient safety and reduce postoperative complications. At the same time, the resident operative experience is enriched. Further enhancement of resident VATSL education in the future may involve surgical simulation.","Suppl. 2     V31af     Times Cited:1     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Resident mentoring has been shown to reduce stress, improve feedback, increase research productivity, improve personal growth and promote career advancement. After the destruction of Hurricane Ike interrupted our program, re-establishment of our radiation oncology program included developing strong satellite rotations for resident education. There were concerns that spreading the geography of residents can lead to isolation of junior residents. As full clinical services returned to Galveston Island it was important to revamp our orientation and mentoring efforts to aid the transition experience of incoming junior residents. A literature search did not find publications describing a formal role modeling experience for incoming residents based on the six core ACGME competencies, and so we piloted a program at our institution. Methods: A program to highlight the six ACGME core competencies was implemented during the first 16 weeks of the academic year. Two incoming residents were each paired with a formal mentor who provided daily supervision during initial clinical training. One resident trainee was paired with the chief resident and placed at a satellite location while the other was paired with an attending at the Galveston location. Residents switched rotations at 8 weeks. Each competency was analyzed and included in daily clinical and academic exercises. Graduated expectations were outlined and evaluated with regular feedback. Dosimetry and advanced treatment planning sessions were organized and mentors lead a weekly journal club to introduce literature, staging, work-up and treatment of common cancers. Incoming residents were included in research and planning meetings. Confidential evaluation of the program was performed with 60 questions modeled after ACGME yearly resident surveys. Incoming residents completed the survey at the end of the initiative with three former residents from the prior two years serving as baseline controls. Results: Incoming residents reported improved morale, ease of transition compared to entry into intern year and ranked their initial program experience and residency selection satisfaction higher when compared to the control group. Specifically, residents exposed to the core competency based program successfully self-selected mentors, started research projects and were interested in leadership within the residency program earlier than prior incoming residents. Conclusions: Mentoring of radiation oncology residents has not been described in the literature. The unique stressors of maintaining cohesiveness within the training program at UTMB with its multiple training locations after a devastating hurricane, challenged us to devise an initiative to weather the storm. We have successfully developed a mentoring program based on ACGME competencies. Initial experience at our institution suggests this approach is feasible and successful. Further implementation in other training programs is needed to validate this approach.","914nd     35     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Surveys such as the 2010 Kaiser Family Foundation highlight this, showing youth are exposed to digital technology for a staggering 7.5 hours of the day. As remote network access improves, portable devices such as smartphones are becoming more integrative. This continual improvement and accessibility of technology, combined with the massive amount of time spent plugged in, offer great potential for educators to reach modern learners. Some studies have evaluated the use of social networking sites for educational purposes with positive results. We sought to apply this trend to our group of pediatric residents to increase satisfaction with and participation in pediatric board examination review, as our previous didactic presentation format was not meeting the needs of the millennial learners. AIM STATEMENT: We planned to increase overall satisfaction with board review and to increase participation by experimenting with various dispensation modalities. INTERVENTIONS: For our first PDSA cycle, board review was changed from a periodic presentation format during scheduled didactic sessions to a daily review question that was distributed digitally via text or email. To increase motivation to participate, residents responded as teams that were based on their clinical assignment. Each month, the team with the most responses won a prize. After 3 months, a survey was distributed to evaluate the change. For our second PDSA cycle, the modality of distribution of the review question was changed to daily postings on a closed Facebook group, which automatically incorporated the questions into each resident's personal news feed. The competition component was eliminated. Initial feedback was again solicited via survey. MEASURES:We used serial PDSA cycles to test the change to a digital daily format for board review. We used multiple surveys through the website Survey Monkey to evaluate our changes. Also, Facebook reports the number of views for each posted question, allowing for quantitative results for the number of residents who accessed each question. RESULTS: Average resident perception of value increased with each modality change (Figure 1). Additionally, for each modality change, at least half of the residents that responded reported an increase in board review participation (Figure 2). Overall, the proportion of residents recalling participation in 10-20 questions per month increased from 36% to 41% (Figure 3). The number of views of Facebook questions average 40.2, which is 63.8% of our residents. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS: For our group of residents, daily board review that could be accessed digitally at any time or location was more valuable than a traditional presentation format. Furthermore, integrating board review into social media increased both perceived educational value and subjectively reported number of questions participated in per month. Next steps include evaluation of the barriers to participation, assessment of in-training exam scores after implementing daily digital board review, and solidifying sustainability of the change through training for future chief residents (Figure Presented).","L617344065     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

However, fatalities still occur due to transfusion related adverse events (TRAEs) (56 in FY2014). A study in New York State revealed the greatest threats occur outside the blood bank and most are human error. Due to significant safety events at a pediatric hospital, the blood product ordering process was evaluated and a redesign was deemed necessary. Study Design/Methods: A newly created role of a Transfusion Safety Officer (TSO) was pivotal to awareness and creation of a multi-disciplinary team. Safety events reported in 2015 were categorized and significant events that impacted patients were evaluated, providers (including pediatric residents) and nurses were interviewed and process mapping was performed. Other institutions (3) electronic ordering practices were inquired about. Results/Findings: The multi-disciplinary team encouraged conversation between nurses, providers, blood bank personnel and clinical informatics staff to discuss available options and determine key components of a new electronic order. In 2015, a total of 74 safety events related to blood products were reported. Patients were directly impacted in 20 events with 1 patient requiring higher level of care. Examples included: excessive volume transfused (3), incorrect rate of transfusion (2), insufficient order (4), transfusion practices not reflective of nursing policy (6), name change during admission (2) and lack of informed consent (3). Interviews with the providers and nurses revealed a need for more clinical decision making tools including clinical practice recommendations on volume dosing, transfusion rate and product special requirement needs. Furthermore, feedback led to an update of the Blood Component Therapy Recommendations by Transfusion Medicine and embedding the recommendations in the new electronic order. Process mapping led to the creation of a white paper outlining the roles, rules and responsibilities of involved health care providers. Information from other institutions assisted with understanding available electronic capabilities. Finally, a ""test drive"" of the new electronic order was done in order to obtain feedback from providers. Conclusion: In order to decrease transfusion error, the TSO is in a prime position to spearhead a multidisciplinary team and liaise with chief quality and safety officers, chief residents, Transfusion Medicine and hospital executives to ensure safety initiatives are met. Safety events, interviews and survey results indicated a need for a drastic change in blood product ordering and provided a framework for a redesign.","eng     Transfusion. 2016 Sep;56 Suppl 4:3A-262A. doi: 10.1111/trf.13807.

Methods Used: The project was carried out in two communities in rural Kenya, selected for the presence of existing CHW programs: Karagita slum and Karate village. No continuing education has been provided since limited initial CHW training was completed in 2009 (Karagita) and 2011 (Karate). CHWs were interviewed about local health issues, resources, and barriers to carrying out CHW duties. A comprehensive list of topics was generated, and used to design training sessions and materials. Resource manuals tailored to community needs were developed. Three topics were addressed in training sessions: HIV, tuberculosis, and diarrheal and opportunistic infections. Summary of Results: CHWs reported worker shortages, little or no compensation, lack of materials, and low morale. Each training session reached between six and sixteen CHWs. Pre- and post-training surveys were administered at each meeting (free response and Likert scale), with self-reported qualitative feedback demonstrating that confidence and topic knowledge increased with training. Manuals were well-received, and will be kept at the community dispensaries. CHWs wrote that the handouts provided were helpful, and expressed a desire for additional training sessions. Teaching materials detailing key contacts and topics have been provided to the locally-based UW Internal Medicine Global Health Chief Resident. Conclusions: The goals of this project - to provide reference manuals, initiate a training program, and establish a continuing education protocol - were met. With the participation of rotating students and residents, future training sessions will be held. Communication between the CHWs and students/ residents will be critical, in order to maintain community engagement. The project has long-term potential, and training resources can be added as needed. This is a low-budget intervention that is welcomed by the CHWs.","Ah7ap     99     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Secondarily we attempted to determine if different emphasis is placed on different subspecialties during residency training and how this may affect the decision to purse fellowship. Methods: An Internet-based multiple-choice survey was sent to the program directors of all U.S. OB/GYN residency programs registered on the CREOG directory. The program directors were asked to forward the link for the survey to their fourth year residents. The survey collected data on demographics, timing and duration of rotations in each subspecialty, and if the timing of subspecialty rotation could have influenced whether or not they pursued fellowship training. Surveys were sent out once in January 2011, then a reminder was sent out 2 weeks later. Results: A total of 136 residents responded to the survey, and 132 of them were PGY-4 or above. Of the respondents the average age was 31; 88.1% were female, 82.2%were from academic-based or university affiliated hospitals. About one third (34.8%) of residents desired fellowship training, and 14.7% of them desired academic careers. Almost all respondents were satisfied with timing of exposure for Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) and Gynecology Oncology (GYN-ONC), 99.2% and 89.9%, respectively. Only 65.1% were satisfied with the timing of rotations in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (REI) and 49.2% with Urogynecology (URO-GYN). We asked what subspecialty did they have the most exposure to; about two third (68.2%) answered MFM, and 27.1% chose GYN-ONC. The majority of respondents (78.1%) preferred to start their URO-GYN rotation before the start of their 3rd year; however only 29.5% did and 11.6% reported that they did not have a rotation in this subspecialty. Finally, just over half (53.4%) of those surveyed reported they finalized their post-residency plans prior to the start of their third year. Conclusions: The results of this survey indicate that many residents desire earlier rotations in URO-GYN. Plans for post-residency often are made prior to PGY-3 and many residents do not have any exposure to URO-GYN before they make these plans. Earlier exposure to URO-GYN may be beneficial for residency training.","L72002480     2015-09-09 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Currently, no websites exist to help training programs improve teaching. Objectives: The objectives of this project are 1) to create a user-friendly website providing support for educators by curating and sharing teaching materials and 2) to study site usage and effectiveness. An ongoing study aims to assist pediatric training programs in increasing the quality and quantity of rheumatology education. Methods: OuchMyLeg! (https://ouchmyleg.northwestern.edu) was designed using Drupal with security measures to protect user confidentiality. Research personnel verify that accounts belong to medical educators before approval. Users belong to either the PRIME community for practicing physicians (mainly pediatric rheumatologists) interested in medical education or the chief resident (CR) community for supervisors of pediatric training programs. Users may link to publicly available educational resources, upload personal instructional materials such as slide sets, documents and videos and download materials posted by others. Copyright infringement rules are posted. PRIME community members were recruited through an email listserv and ads at two pediatric rheumatology conferences. Chief residents were invited by emails sent to all U.S. pediatric training program administrators. CR users were required to tick a box giving consent to be a study subject and take a needs assessment survey before accessing site materials. Usage statistics were collected with Google Analytics. Results: As of January 2015, the PRIME community has 204 users from 40 countries: USA-156, Canada-11, UK-6, Brazil-3, Germany-3, India-3, Israel-3, Hungary-2, Jordan-2, Saudi Arabia-2, Spain-2 and one each from Colombia, France, Italy, Mexico, Latvia, the Netherlands, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden and Turkey. Members include pediatric rheumatologists-164, fellows- 27, nurses-8 and research associates-5. 205 training program administrators were emailed, 74 (36%) expressed interest by providing chief resident contact information, 136 chief residents were invited to join the CR community, 61 signed up for an account and 31 (23%) completed the entrance survey. 25 public (pub) resources are available to both communities. 5 users posted a total of 18 private (pri) resources. Resources include links to websites containing cases, review articles, interactive tutorials and clinical phone applications (13 pub), rheumatology curriculum materials (3 pub), image banks (2 pub), instructional videos (2 pub), musculoskeletal exam instruction (1 pub), education guidelines (1 pub), case studies (3 pub, 1 pri), exam study materials (1 pub, 3 pri), disease-based lectures (10 pri), a pediatric rheumatology primer (1 pri) and an instructional technique lecture (1 pri). Conclusions: The creation of a members-only instructional materials-sharing website was feasible. Recruitment for the PRIME community was successful with over 200 worldwide users. Recruitment for the CR community was less successful possibly due to the entry survey requirement. Only 2.5% of PRIME members posted resources indicating reluctance to share personal teaching materials. User feedback will address barriers to sharing. The CR community study is ongoing. We hope to prove website usability and educational improvement.","L72152145     2016-01-16 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Will the fellowship interfere with chief resident experience or case volume? We hypothesize that the presence of an advanced laparoscopic fellow in our tertiary care hospital and residency has had no deleterious effect on chief resident laparoscopic case volume. Methods: We reviewed the operative case logs of our graduating residents, fellows from 2002 to 2009. We focused on the laparoscopic basic and complex cases and compared it between those 2 groups and compared our residents' case numbers to the national average published by the ACGME and minimum case number defined by the American Board of Surgery (ABS). Results: Our Residents graduating from 2002-2009 (4-5 Chief residents per year) performed an average of 902.9 +/- 56.4 laparoscopic cases per graduating chief class with each chief averaging 205.4 +/- 12.7. The average laparoscopic basic cases per graduating chief year were 505.1 +/- 28.2 with each chief averaging 114.6 +/- 5.5. The average laparoscopic complex cases per graduating chief year were 397.7 +/- 37.6 with each chief averaging 90.8 +/- 9.1. With regards our fellows over the same period of time, they performed an average of 352 +/- 26 cases per year. When comparing our residents' total average laparoscopic cases to the national data, our residents did perform more cases overall (199.8 +/- 13.6 vs. 171.45 +/- 7).

Research on the topic is minimal and has never been performed within Canadian emergency medicine training programs. Objectives: The objective was to perform the first national survey of Canadian FRCP (Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians) EM (emergency medicine) residents, pediatric EM residents, and their respective program directors to determine if outcome feedback is obtained for patients treated in the emergency department. The study simultaneously investigated and compared the perceived educational value of outcome feedback by residents and program directors. Methods: We distributed surveys to all Canadian FRCP and Pediatric EM programs. Using a modified Dillman method, program directors received an online survey while residents received a paper version distributed by their chief residents during mandatory academic sessions. The piloted surveys contained 20 and 19 questions respectively regarding outcome feedback systems, educational values, and demographics. P values were calculated using student's t-test and Fisher's exact test. Results: Completed surveys were collected from 188 of 237 eligible residents (79.3%) and 21 of 24 program directors (87.5%) for an overall response rate of 80.0%. Mandatory patient follow-up was not present in any EM training program for admitted or discharged patients. Followup was performed electively by 91.4% of residents for patients admitted to the hospital, and by 49.1% of residents for patients discharged home. A majority of residents (77.5%) believed that some type of patient follow-up should be mandatory as compared to 42.8% of program directors (p=0.005). The perceived educational value of outcome feedback was 5.8/7 for residents and 5.1/7 for program directors (difference 0.70; p=0.003) based on a seven point Likert scale (1=Not important; 7=Very important). Conclusion: While Canadian EM training programs do not mandate follow-up it is performed electively by the majority of residents surveyed. Residents place a significantly greater educational value on outcome feedback than their program directors, and believe that followup should be a mandatory component of Canadian EM residencies.","eng     Congresses     Overall     Acad Emerg Med. 2013 May;20 Suppl 1:S4-367. doi: 10.1111/acem.12115.

E. and Christmas, C.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000331939302444,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Morning report is an age-old venue for teaching in residency training. New challenges to resident work hours have challenged these old teaching paradigms. We sought to capture the essential teaching points from the Johns Hopkins Bayview Internal Medicine residency program's daily morning reports and synthesize them into an educational tool for our housestaff. We created the Podcast Pearl, an audio file consisting of teaching pearls from each morning report, and sent it electronically to residents and faculty at the end of each week. We aimed to assess the impact this weekly audio recording had on resident and faculty education, satisfaction, and connectedness to the residency program. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We distributed the Podcast Pearl audio file to 57 residents and 49 faculty members at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. DESCRIPTION: To create the Podcast Pearl, one of the Assistant Chiefs of Service (chief residents) helped the resident presenter identify the salient teaching points from the morning report, and then conducted a brief 1- 2 min interview with the resident using a digital recording device. These recordings were edited using freely available software (iTunes, Wavosaur), converted into 6-8 min MP3 recordings, and sent via secure intranet to residents and teaching faculty weekly. After 4 months of use, the residents and teaching faculty were surveyed to examine utilization patterns, educational impact, satisfaction, and degree of connectedness to the residency program. EVALUATION: 30 out of 57 residents (53 %) and 18 out of 49 (37 %) of teaching faculty responded to the survey. 26.6 % of residents reported they attended morning report more than 70 % of the time. 70 % of residents reported using the Podcast Pearl, with 23 % using at least half of the recordings. 60 % of residents who listened to the Podcast Pearl used a computer, 35 % used a smartphone, and 10 % used a tablet. 100 % of residents who used 1 or more Podcast Pearls and who were not able to attend morning report (due to ICU rotations, vacation, etc.) reported that they learned something new. 46 % reported they learned something new often or always. 100 % of teaching faculty who responded to the survey reported using 1 or more of the Podcast Pearls, with 56 % reporting using at least half of the recordings, and 17 % reporting using all available recordings. Faculty were more likely than residents (94 % vs. 60 %) to use a computer to listen to the Podcast Pearl. 56 % of faculty reported that the Podcast Pearl improved their learning. 94 % of faculty reported that listening to the Podcast Pearl made them feel more connected to housestaff. 78 % of faculty strongly agreed that educators should integrate technology into residency curricula. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: A brief, weekly recording of teaching pearls from daily morning reports within an internal medicine residency program was a popular educational tool among both residents and teaching faculty. Residents tended to be more likely to use smartphones and tablets to listen to the educational recording, whereas faculty were more likely to use computers. The Podcast Pearl was an effective educational supplement for residents unable to attend morning report. This recording made nearly all faculty feel more connected to the residency program. Though further study of objective educational outcomes is needed, a brief weekly recording of teaching pearls in the form of a podcast is a satisfying educational supplement for residents and faculty.","Suppl. 1     Ab6zp     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Methods: We performed a retrospective review and comparison of operative case logs from 1946 to 1953 and 2009 to 2015. Early logs were obtained from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center which served as a single center urology training program at that time. Modern logs were obtained from the descendant program which now combines training with an affiliated University Medical Center. Case logs were analyzed for chief resident case volume, top 5 procedures, surgical approach and procedure category.     Results: Mean case volume was 105.8 per year (early) and 315.7 per year (modern, p < 0.001). Top early period procedures were transurethral resection of the prostate, ureterolithotomy, nephrostomy, hydrocelectomy and suprapubic cystostomy, and mean transurethral prostate resection frequency was 28.4 per year (early) compared to 4.6 per year (modern, p < 0.005). Mean procedures per year by approach were 125.9 open and 50.5 endoscopic (early) compared to 199.8 open and 151 endoscopic (modern, p < 0.001). For procedure category the proportion of general urology and endourology did not change while that of oncology and reconstruction increased.     Conclusions: Findings from the comparison of chief resident surgical case logs over 70 years show that modern residents perform a higher number of cases and continue to perform a large portion of open cases despite the widespread use of minimally invasive surgical techniques. These changes may serve to highlight the adaptability of urology as a surgical subspecialty.","Gl4oi     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:9 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Despite being responsible for higher mortality rates than sepsis or myocardial infarction, delirium is often not diagnosed or improperly addressed. We evaluated resident's level of knowledge and confidence in regards to delirium in order to inform future formative interventions. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was given to third year medical residents. Chief Residents emailed all residents with information on the nature of the survey with a brief explanation of the importance of delirium. The 15 questions were designed to elicit basic knowledge in diagnosis, predisposing and precipitating factors; prevalence, prevention, management, attitudes and beliefs. The responses were tabulated in tables and interpreted by consensus. Results: 30 0f 45 residents completed the survey. 72 % had never used a delirium assessment tool. 50 % did not feel they have a good working knowledge of the diagnosis of delirium. 49% thought they did not have adequate training in delirium with only 33% feeling comfortable managing it. Half thought delirium is under-recognized in the emergency department. 77% of resident thought that staffing constraints augment the need for restraints. 1/3 of our participants would use a high dose haloperidol or benzodiazepine to control hyperactive delirium. Delirium features was described as altered level of consciousness and fluctuating in 67% of the respondent. The predisposing factors most frequently recognized were age (27%) and baseline cognitive status (27%). Of precipitating factors, acute illness was the most recognized (77%) followed by medications (67%) and environment (60%). Conclusion: The study illustrates the deficits of third year medical residents in regards to delirium. They expressed concern about the adequacy of their baseline knowledge and most were unaware of any validated instrument to diagnose delirium. Half felt that they did not have enough training in delirium and only 1/3 of the residents felt confident in managing delirium. This lack of confidence is accompanied by lack of awareness of predisposing and precipitating factors of delirium all of which impact the care of the hospitalized elderly. The study is important in creating future educational interventions to solidify Geriatric teaching in our institution.","L70738007     2012-05-16 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Our investigation aims to determine trends in the axillary SLN biopsies performed at our institution. We hypothesize that the use of both radiotracer and either methylene blue or Lymphazurin blue (dual tracer) as well as the timing of the radiotracer injection impacts the ability to identify the SLN. Methods: After IRB approval, we retrospectively reviewed our database of patients who underwent SLN biopsy from May 2012 to May 2017 at our institution. One hundred twenty-five patients were initially identified. Patients were excluded if they had bilateral disease or if they did not have a true SLN biopsy. The type of tracer used, location of radiotracer injection, the operative time, as well as the number of total nodes and positive nodes removed were noted. The post-graduate year of the resident involved in the case was also noted. Additionally, the surgeon was classified as Senior versus Junior faculty, with more than 15 years and less than 15 years of practice respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab Release 14 Statistical software (Minitab Inc., State College, PA). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Chi-Square were used to identify various relationships in our dataset. A statistical significance was accepted for p<0.05. Results: We identified 107 analyzable patients who met our inclusion criteria. Six (5.6%) underwent SLN biopsy with radiotracer alone, 16 (15.0%) with methylene blue alone, 10 (9.3%) with Lymphazurin blue alone, and 75 (70.1%) with both radiotracer and either methylene or Lymphazurin blue. The average number of lymph nodes removed in each case was 1.8 (range 1-4), 3.8 (range 1-15), 1.6 (range 0-6), and 2.7 (range 1-12), respectively, which was not statistically significant (p=0.136). The average operative time (minutes) was 182 (range 139-234), 134 (range 69-188), 138 (range 99-196), and 158 (range 72- 339), respectively. There was no statistical difference in length of case based solely on type of tracer used (p=0.66). In comparing biopsies in which the radiotracer was injected in Nuclear Medicine on the day of surgery versus in the pre-operative holding area by the surgeon, there was no difference in operative time (p=0.66) or number of nodes removed (p=0.136). There were not enough data points to analyze the impact of intra-operative injection. Of the biopsies performed, 65 (60.7%) were performed by our Junior faculty, while 42 (39.3%) were performed by our Senior faculty. There was no significant difference in the length of case based on surgeon type (p=0.466). However, our Senior faculty removed more total nodes than Junior faculty (p=0.014), while our Junior faculty tended to use a dual tracer method in comparison to our Senior faculty (p=0.011), which were both statistically significant. While there was no statistical difference in total number of nodes removed by resident year (p=0.391), chief residents were found to remove more positive lymph nodes (p=0.008). Conclusions: Currently at our institution, there is no difference in success rates for axillary SLN biopsy based on tracer type used or years of practice for the operating surgeon. Additionally, our current data demonstrate that same-day injection (in Nuclear Medicine versus in the pre-operative holding area) has no impact on operative time or ability to identify the SLN. However, our current practice has begun to shift, in that we have begun to inject the radiotracer intra-operatively. We plan to further analyze this change in practice to determine if intra-operative injection radiotracer impacts the ability to identify the SLN and/or if it improves patient satisfaction by eliminating an injection into the breast in an awake patient.","eng     News     Ann Surg Oncol. 2018 Jun;25(Suppl 2):231-603. doi: 10.1245/s10434-018-6534-2.

We identified a need for better central line training in our residency program, with a majority of outgoing third year residents citing procedure training as an area requiring improvement. We implemented a structured and interactive central line teaching workshop for our incoming intern class. Our aim was to improve knowledge and confidence in placement of central lines and to maximize patient safety by teaching standardized technique. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed this curriculum for our mid-sized internal medicine residency program (64 total residents per year) based at an urban county hospital. Participants included all incoming internal medicine interns matriculating in the 2014 academic year. The teaching sessions were coordinated and staffed by a combination of senior house staff, chief residents and faculty. DESCRIPTION: We conducted central line training sessions one half day each week during the first month of the academic year for all incoming interns (primary care, categorical, and preliminary interns were included n=30). Training sessions were 3 h in length. Each session was divided into four 20-30 min sections covering the following topics: 1. Orientation to a standardized checklist outlining indications, contraindications, materials needed, and procedure complications. Participants received a card version of the checklist with instructions to place in their badge holders as a portable reference. 2. Interns received sterile technique instruction with a primer on proper sterile procedure followed by supervised gown and glove donning with real time feedback. 3. Ultrasound training with orientation to the use of the machine. Interns then used a practice mannequin to correctly identify structures in the neck. 4. To close out the session, each intern was asked to place a central line on the simulation mannequin while being supervised by a senior resident or faculty member with critique and feedback. EVALUATION: The pilot workshop required all participants to perform a pre-and post intervention test evaluating general knowledge about central line procedures, indications, contraindications, elements of the central line bundle, basic ultrasound technology, and complications. The workshop was concluded by a brief oral examination. After passing the oral examination each intern received a certification card allowing them to perform a supervised bedside procedure. Data revealed that attendees improved their knowledge of correctly obtaining informed consent (33 vs. 93 % correct pre/post-session) and correct use of the ultrasound probe in inserting central lines (70 vs. 96 % pre/post). Pre-test data showed that interns on average could not name any components of the central line bundle and after the session could name 2 items from the bundle. There was no significant difference before and after the session in terms of knowledge about indications for central lines or labs/ studies to be ordered before and after central line placement. Prior to beginning the workshop, we surveyed all PGY-2 and PGY-3 to assess confidence of residents for performing central lines and knowledge of complications and indications. This historical control datawill be compared to the intervention group PGY-1's at the halfway point of the academic year to demonstrate sustained efficacy and improved confidence. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: The central line training workshop piloted in this study was effective in teaching interns the basic knowledge and skills necessary to perform the internal jugular central line procedure. Further long term data can confirm whether these positive results are sustained. Notably, this pilot intervention was feasible, addressed an important need and was relatively inexpensive and not resource intensive. Our sessions were well received by the intern class and feedback from senior residents indicated that they desired to go through the workshop as well. Faculty have i dicated that the intern class who participated in this pilot workshop was better prepared, identified and collected procedure materials correctly, obtained effective informed consents, and ultimately were more equipped to perform an actual patient procedure under supervision safely. . Further analysis could evaluate the long term efficacy of a structured central line training workshop with respect to resident competence as well as clinical outcomes such as resource utilization, central line infection rates, number of central lines placed, adherence to the central line bundle components, and complication rates.","Suppl. 2     Cn4fv     2197908     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

METHODS: Informed consent was waived for this institutional review board-exempt, HIPAA-compliant, prospective quality improvement study. From January 29, 2015 to December 10, 2015, semiweekly rounds lasting approximately 60 min were held between the on-call acute care surgery team (attending surgeon, chief resident, and residents) and one of three expert abdominal radiologists. A comprehensive imaging review was performed of recent and comparison examinations for cases selected by the surgeons in which medical and/or surgical decision making was pending. All reviewed examinations had available finalized reports known to the surgical team. RADPEER interradiologist concordance scores were assigned to all reviewed examinations. The impression and plan of the attending surgeon were recorded before and after each in-person review. RESULTS: One hundred patients were reviewed with 11 attending surgeons. The in-person meetings led to changes in surgeons' diagnostic impressions in 43% (43 of 100) and changes in medical and/or surgical planning in 43% (43 of 100; 20 acute changes, 23 nonacute changes, 19 changes in operative management) of cases. There were major discrepancies (RADPEER score >/=3) between the impression of the reviewing radiologist and the written report in 11% of cases (11 of 100). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted in-person collaboration between radiologists and acute care surgeons is associated with substantial and frequent changes in patient management, even when the original written report contains all necessary data. The primary mechanism seems to be promotion of a shared mental model that facilitates the exchange of complex information.","Dickerson, Elliot C     Alam, Hasan B     Brown, Richard K J     Stojanovska, Jadranka     Davenport, Matthew S     eng     J Am Coll Radiol. 2016 Aug;13(8):943-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jacr.2016.02.005.

C. and Nead, K. and Mendoza, M. and Fortuna, R. J.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000358386900259,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Continuity and longitudinal care of patients are cornerstones of primary care and have been associated with improved outcomes in care. Providing a longitudinal primary care experience between residents and patients is a key goal of residency training. Our objective was to identify factors that are associated with increased continuity in residency teaching practices and to examine how continuity is associated with quality measures. METHODS: We analyzed 120,400 patient visits to four resident continuity programs in Upstate New York between 7/1/2013 and 6/30/14. We defined continuity from both the resident and patient perspective. Resident continuity was defined as the percent of patients seen by a resident who are their primary patient. Patient continuity was defined as the percent of all patient visits seen by either their primary resident or team attending. We surveyed program directors, clinic directors, office managers, and chief residents to determine what factors each site used to promote continuity. Data were analyzed using chi square tests for proportions and Cochran-Armitage tests for trends. Logistic regression models were used to examine the independent influence of factors on continuity. RESULTS: Resident continuity ranged from 33.1 to 83.7 % between sites. Patient continuity ranged from 20.6 to 71.5 %. Factors associated with improved resident continuity included absence of physician extenders (nurse practitioners or physician assistants) (71.5% vs 51.7%; P<0.001), advancing post-graduate year (PGY) of resident . (54.9 to 69.9%; P<0.001), offering morning clinic sessions (59.5% vs 33.1%; P<0.001), increased mean clinical faculty FTE (33.1 to 71.5 %; P<0.001), scheduling protocol for acute visits (41.1 % vs 77.5 %; P<0.001), and having a policy for patient dismissal for missed appointments (51.7 % vs 71.5 %; P<0.001). Similarly, factors associated with improved patient continuity include included absence of physician extenders, advancing PGY, offering morning clinic sessions, providing more than one clinical session per week with the primary resident, increased mean clinical faculty FTE, scheduling protocols, and having a patient dismissal policy (P<0.001 for all). Increased patient continuity was associated with improved rates of diabetic control (54.6 to 62.8 %; P<0.001), hypertension control (57.5 to 82.8 %; P<0.001), screening colonoscopy (31.9 to 69.2 %; P<0.001), and screening mammography (38.2 to 74.8 %; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Variations in resident and patient continuity are associated with a number of modifiable clinic factors. Increased clinical faculty time, scheduling protocols, and the absence of physician extenders were most strongly associated with increasing continuity. Improving continuity may help improve important quality measures, including diabetic control, hypertension control, and cancer screening rates.","Suppl. 2     Cn4fv     2194668     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Mean scores, expressed in seconds/tablet, and overall improvement (percentage difference between warm-up and follow-up) were analyzed according to postgraduate standing (PGY14), dexterity skills, and pertinent vocational activities. RESULTS: Significant improvements were noted for both residents (+25%) and medical students (+29%), P<0.0001. Scores between the 2 groups, however, were not significant (P=0.677). Proficiency was not influenced by PGY standing. Interestingly, the best (8.73 sec/pill) and the worst (25 sec/pill) scores were attained by a medical student and a chief resident, respectively, suggesting the contribution of individual aptitude.

Although LARC education and insertion techniques are required in the OB-GYN residency curriculum, barriers may negatively affect the quality of training. Methods: This anonymous survey used structured questions about residents' experience with LARC training, including number of LARC insertions. The survey questions were administered electronically in conjunction with the 2016 resident CREOG in-service exam; de-identified data were categorized for analysis by US census regions (Northeast, West, Midwest, South). Results: The response rate for questions about number of LARC insertion was 99%. As of January 2016, 32% of all residents inserted 1-10 IUDs and 31.7% inserted 11-25 IUDs; 39.6% of residents inserted 1-10 contraceptive implants. In total, 8% of chief residents had never inserted an implant and 10% had inserted between 1-10 IUDs Nearly a third of all residents and 40% of Southern residents identified finan-cial barriers, including cost of the device and inadequate insurance coverage, to LARC training. Twenty percent of residents reported institutional policy and 27% reported lack of patient demand as additional barriers. Religious affiliation was reported as a significant barrier only by residents in the Midwest (27%, P<.001) compared to all other residents (6.4%).

Similarly, while many departments boast Directors of Patient Safety or Quality, chief residents in this role have only appeared in the past several years. Current literature has only outlined the Quality and Patient Safety (QPS) Chief Resident role in internal medicine. Objective: The EM QPS Chief Resident role was created for the current academic year by the EM residency leadership. The inaugural chief and administration worked together to develop multiple safety and quality improvement projects and to redesign the QPS educational curriculum. Design: The QPS Chief was integral to several projects. 1) The chief helped design and implement the role out of a new ED-based standardized physician-to-physician handoff tool. 2) The chief helped design and implement a day-long training session on root cause analysis. 3) The chief wrote weekly safety tips for a residency-wide update e-mail to facilitate asynchronous learning of QPS definitions and basic concepts. 4) The chief has been involved in ongoing planning through the GME office to create a Quality Educator Academy to train junior faculty to appropriately mentor residents in quality improvement projects. 5) The chief has aided debriefs of simulation scenarios for improving communication and teamwork. 6) The chief continued to perform usual chief resident role including taking call and helping run the day-to-day residency activities. Impact: Through the safety tips, the entire residency has been exposed to the science of safety and quality improvement. All residents have participated in a mock root cause analysis, placing them at level 4 for the PS1 milestone. The hand-off process has been implemented at two campuses with plans to study change in error rates. The next QPS Chief will build on this foundation to better improve and execute the QPS curriculum for the residency.","eng     Acad Emerg Med. 2015 May;22 Suppl 1:S3-S449. doi: 10.1111/acem.12644.

Materials and Methods: A low cost VH simulation model was created and validation was performed in two phases. In the first phase face validity was performed using a convenience sample of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Figure Presented) Resident Physicians and Faculty. The model was rated in terms of anatomic accuracy and tactile realism by the surgeons using a 5-point Likert scale; as well as their opinion on the educational usefulness of the model. In the second phase, the construct validity of the VH model for simulating critical steps of a VH was assessed when the videotaped performances of the Gynecology resident and attending physicians performing VH on the model were evaluated by two blinded expert vaginal surgeons using the Reznick's validated Global Rating Scale of Operative Performance (GRS). The interrater reliability of the GRS was measured by comparing the GRS scores of the two-blinded faculty members using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Due to the small sample size construct validity of the model was evaluated by comparing the mean GRS scores between two groups; more junior residents (PGY1-3) and the chief resident (PGY-4) and faculty attendings using the independent sample t-test. Results: A total of six participants (one resident each from PGY1-4 and two attending physicians) from 2 academic centers rated the VH model and performed a vaginal hysterectomy using the simulation model. Phase 1 result (face validity). The surgeons' average rating of anatomic accuracy and tactile realism (of possible 5 points) were 3.7 and 2.5, respectively. Overall, participants found the VH model to be at least a ''very valuable'' educational tool for novice surgeons, particularly for junior and senior residents. Phase 2 (construct validity). The inter-rater reliability for the blinded faculty in this study was 0.65 (good agreement). The average VH experience of the group of more experienced surgeons PGY-4 and faculty attendings prior to performing the simulation was 21 (4-50) compared to the group of less experienced surgeons (PGY1-3) less than 1 (0-2). The mean Global Rating Scale score of more experienced surgeons performing vaginal hysterectomy on the model was 25.9 +/- 6.14 was significantly higher than that of less experienced surgeons 8.83 +/- 2.02 (p = 0.01).

Both the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the American Medical Association have declared this to be a national issue. To combat growing rates of burnout, residencies have implemented various wellness curricula. Most interventions, however, have been studied in isolation. The effects of a comprehensive, multi-faceted program have not been extensively evaluated. The present study was designed to assess the impact of a comprehensive wellness programon resident physician well-being in a large academic hospital. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: At the start of the 2016-2017 academic year, a new wellness program was integrated within the Washington University in St Louis internal medicine residency curriculum at Barnes Jewish Hospital142 internal medicine residents at all training levels participated in this curriculum. DESCRIPTION: Awellness committee, comprised of faculty, chief residents, and resident representatives, was established. Curricula were created for largegroup lectures, small-group workshops and team building exercises. Required large-group lectures taught evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to help residents during times of stress. Small-group sessions were designed to cover a selection of wellness-related topics, including imposter syndrome, defining success, and maintaining compassion. All small group didactics occur during protected time on inpatient rotations and are facilitated by licensed clinical psychologists. Team-building exercises include both organized social outings for the entire residency, as well as monthly competitions between inpatient teams, with awarded group prizes. EVALUATION: Resident-physician burnout prevalence was assessed at the start of the 2016-2017 academic year using the Maslach Burnout Inventory on a voluntary basis. Final analysis of this initial survey is currently pending. Small-group sessions were anonymously evaluated by participants through a standardized form after each session. We will survey residents using the Maslach Burnout Inventory again at the end of the academic year to look for improvement in burnout prevalence. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Burnout is defined as a combination of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion and decreased perceived accomplishment. Trials have shown CBT techniques can reduce compassion fatigue and enhance resilience, while small-group and teambuilding exercises can increase perceived compensation and accomplishment. By employing modalities to address each element of physician burnout, it is expected that this comprehensive wellness program will improve resident wellbeing.","Suppl. 2     Go7oj     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

A. and Raveneau, G. and Rosen, L. and Fisher, M.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000300243000128,English,,,"Purpose: Although the vast majority of youth with an eating disorder (ED) are treated as outpatients, some require treatment on an inpatient unit. The purpose of this study was to determine the attitudes of nurses and pediatric residents towards adolescents and young adults with eating disorders admitted to a busy adolescent medical unit in a suburban Children's Hospital. Methods: Pediatric residents and nurses staffing an adolescent medicine unit and a pediatric emergency room were eligible for the study. Nursing questionnaires were distributed through the nurse manager. Resident questionnaires were distributed in coordination with the chief residents. Using Likert scales, the survey included questions related to 1) demographic and occupational data, 2) signs and symptoms associated with an eating disorder, 3) perceived etiologies of an eating disorder, 4) personal attitudes towards youth with an eating disorder, 5) the effectiveness of possible treatments, and 6) whether respondents believed that patients were responsible for their eating disorder. The study was approved by an Institutional Review Board. Results: Eighty-two individuals (thirty-two nurses and fifty pediatric residents) completed the survey. Only two nurses and six residents had not worked with a patient with an eating disorder in the previous year. The vast majority of nurses and residents recognized that fear of gaining weight, refusal to maintain body weight and disturbed body image were frequent signs occurring in patients with an ED. Both nurses and residents believed that emotional problems, influence of friends and family, family pressure, influence of the media, and self-induced were the most likely causes of eating disorders. Genetics and influence of other medical problems were deemed to be less likely causes. Nurses and residents both identified psychotherapy/ counseling, family therapy, medication, education, nutrition, and behavior modification as effective treatments for ED. Residents also felt that urging patients to take more control was an effective treatment. The majority of nurses identified change of doctors and nurses each week, having different rules for different patients and poor communication as factors that create difficulties in caring for ED patients. The majority of residents identified having different rules for different patients and poor communication as factors that make it difficult to take care of ED patients. More than half of all nurses and residents (58.2%) thought that ED patients were responsible for their disease always or in most cases. The most common emotions nurses felt towards ED patients were sympathy, sadness, frustration, and pity. Frustration, sadness, pity, and helplessness were the most common emotions felt by residents. Residents (68.8%) were more likely than nurses (45.2%) to frequently feel frustrated with ED patients (chi-square, P<0.0370). Conclusions: Adolescents with an eating disorder provide a unique challenge to nurses and residents caring for them. Optimizing the care provided to adolescents with an eating disorder requires a multidisciplinary effort focused on maximizing communication, establishing and adhering to protocols, educating staff and intensive support of nurses and residents when adjustments to policies and protocols are needed to optimize treatment.","Suppl.

The volume and logistics of disseminating educational materials and coordinating the educational program poses challenges, and compromises the quality of the learning experience for residents. To provide a centralized site for dissemination and management of educational resources and information, archive important educational materials, and coordinate the educational program delivery, the PCSM program has implemented a wiki-based education and resource tool. CONTENT: To test potential feasibility and effectiveness, we piloted a wiki for an interactive seminar series on health and human rights. Previously, materials for these seminars were distributed to residents in a large binder. Homework and correspondence was exchanged via email, and schedules were produced on paper. On the wiki, we posted the schedule for seminar series, readings, discussion questions, and session updates. Residents shared answers to discussion questions in the collaborative environment of the wiki. Due to the success of the course wiki, a larger program resource wiki was launched. In addition to materials for didactic sessions taking place during the month, this wiki contains resources for ambulatory practice and education, including forms used for ambulatory morning report, critical appraisal of journal articles, and commonly used screening instruments. An archive of clinical questions critically appraised by residents is also maintained. Monthly outpatient schedules, which include all ambulatory teaching activities are posted on the wiki (via Google calendar) and can be synced to residents' PDAs. DESIGN: Using the free, public wiki resource PBworks, the wikis are organized using themed folders populated with relevant materials including word documents, power point slides and PDF documents. Material is posted by faculty and students; the site is maintained by the chief resident and program manager. The wikis are password protected. EVALUATION: Following 3 months of implementation, a written evaluation was given to the 20 residents who had used the wikis. Preliminary evaluation data shows that residents find the wiki to be convenient, accurate and reliable. Additional comments include, Saves paper and easy to access, Access to an accurate, up to date calendar is great, and, A great and useful addition to the program. Residents also report finding it challenging to read large amounts of material in PDF form. SUMMARY: The PCSM Residency Program at Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center has successfully implemented both a course specific and program wide education and resource wiki. Based on preliminary data, we believe the wiki can be an effective tool in medical education and warrants further use and expansion.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Gen Intern Med. 2010 Jun;25 Suppl 3:S205-567. doi: 10.1007/s11606-010-1338-5.

All categorical and preliminary interns in the Yale Primary Care Residency Program were invited. The Chief Residents established a period - 9 pm Friday through 5 pm Sunday - during which time residents covered their intern colleagues' hospital responsibilities. DESCRIPTION: Our Retreat was built on our primary goals: 1. Enhance teambuilding while allowing expression of internship-related stress. Interns lined up in response to queries such as most introverted to most extraverted, and revealed answers to questions such as, What adjectives might a person use to describe you when they are angry at you? Later, a faculty member facilitated a discussion regarding stressors. 2. Provide a forum for information about various programmatic initiatives. Interns participated in research speed dating in which pairs had limited time with one faculty member to learn about ongoing projects before moving on to another faculty member. 3. Facilitate interns' learning from shared experiences to create a context from which they could approach the next phase of their year. The Program Director and Chief Residents held a session discussing high and low points of the year, allowing common experiences and themes to be shared. NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: With ACGME-mandated scheduling changes compounding expected stresses of internship, we sought to provide reassurance, camaraderie, and personal and professional growth to interns completing the first few months of their year. Our specific objectives included: 1. Enhance teambuilding while allowing expression of internshiprelated stress. 2. Provide a forum for information about various programmatic initiatives. 3. Facilitate interns' learning from shared experiences to create a context from which they could approach the next phase of their year. EVALUATION: Intern Attendance: 80% of class Post-Retreat Questionnaire Results: 100% of attendees Agree or Strongly Agree with the statements on a Likert Scale: [This] was an appropriate location in which to have this Retreat and Overall, this Retreat was a valuable part of my internship. Representative Quotations from the Post-Retreat Questionnaire: I valued the bonding at the campfire, and our team building activity because it made me appreciate my colleagues even more than before. I feel like our class is closer together and will work better together The Intern Retreat should happen every year. The Retreat created a stronger sense of community I feel more invested in our group success and the program's success. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Participant feedback suggests the overarching goals of the experience were achieved, a key measure of its potential sustainability. We specifically gleaned the following incites from planning, implementing, and reviewing this year's Retreat: 1. Establish approximately as much free time as structured activities in the Retreat's itinerary. 2. Allow at least 4 months before the Retreat to find and reserve an appropriate location; many Retreat Centers are booked months in advance. 3. Do not make plans in a vacuum; elicit suggestions from all housestaff and faculty members in conceptualizing a Retreat that fits a Program's needs. 4. Choose the Retreat date when intern schedules are created. Therefore, intern vacation time can be avoided. 5. Incorporate Intern Retreat coverage into upper-level residents' schedules from their time of creation, thus eliminating the chance of prior engagements.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Gen Intern Med. 2011 May;26 Suppl 1:S1-620. doi: 10.1007/s11606-011-1730-9.

To date, surgical literature has addressed neither measurements of resident autonomy and level of responsibility nor the effects these factors may have on resident confidence and future practice plans. Our preliminary study sought to: 1) characterize perceived autonomy in different types of surgeries during the final year of training, 2) characterize actual resident experience in the same areas, and 3) correlate these with resident confidence to meet the standard of care and anticipated scope of practice following completion of training. Materials and Methods: An online survey was made available to residents in their final year of OMS training in all US programs. The survey addressed resident case exposure and level of participation in care in several domains within OMS: mandibular trauma, midface trauma, TMJ surgery, orthognathics, pathology, reconstruction, craniofacial, cosmetics, implants, and other dentoalveolar surgery. The questionnaire also measured the perceived ability to meet the standard of care and anticipated frequency of practice in each of these domains. Some basic respondent demographics were also recorded. Data Analysis: Data collection was from May 2010 to September 2010. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP 8.0 software. Differences were assessed using oneway ANOVA and Student t test as well as Pearson correlations. Trends were identified using Mantel-Haenszel test and an ROC curve was utilized to identify values at which frequencies changed. Statistical significance was defined at P values or rho values less than 0.05. Results: A total of 84 surveys (45%) were completed. Mean age was 33 years. Respondents were 89% male. 13% of respondents had plans for fellowship training and 58% planned to practice in an area population of over 500,000. Over the course of residency, practice plans narrowed in 23%, broadened in 29%, and remained the same in 49%. Increases in autonomy from junior to senior level were noted in all domains. As primary surgeon, mean cases during chief year were 24.6 (midface trauma), 40.7 (mandibular trauma), 9.9 (TMJ), 32 (orthognathic), 11.3 (cosmetics), 33.5 (pathology), 23.7 (reconstruction), 4.5 (craniofacial), 61.4 (implants), and 174.7 (dentoalveolar). Confidence to meet the standard of care among the respondents in each of the domains was: 89% (midface trauma), 100% (mandibular trauma), 45% (TMJ), 80% (orthognathic), 29% (cosmetics), 78% (pathology), 73% (reconstruction), 30% (craniofacial), 94% (implants), and 100% (dentoalveolar). The number of cases as primary surgeon to determine the frequency of future practice in a particular domain was found to be: 12 (midface trauma), 10 (TMJ), 11 (cosmetics), 35 (pathology), 13 (reconstruction), and 8 (craniofacial). Conclusions: In general, resident autonomy showed a statistical correlation with the confidence to meet the standard of care. In addition, the number of cases as primary surgeon during the chief year was associated with the anticipated frequency of practice in a given domain. Consistent measures of autonomy are involvement in treatment planning, involvement in performing the case, and overall sense or autonomy and not the presence or absence of the attending faculty during the procedure. These preliminary findings could help guide residency programs in the training of competent residents in the future. Plans are in place to repeat this survey for consecutive years with a broader, more expansive inquiry in order to quantify year-to-year variations in experience and attitudes.","L70525078     2011-09-12 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

With popularity of the specialty, residency programs are receiving and sorting through numerous applications in order to compile their rank lists. Although there is literature on how applicants rank programs, there are few data on what criteria emergency medicine residencies use to select applicants. Objectives: Our study investigates which components of the application were most predictive of securing a rank list spot. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of EM residency applicants over a 4-year period at a community-based universityaffiliated emergency medicine program comprised of eight allopathic positions per year. Over 600 candidates apply annually, with 100 invited to interview. Interviews were open-file, conducted by three or four academic faculty members and one chief resident, and scored on a standardized numerical scale. Interviewers were not blinded to the applicants' academic records. Applicants' interview scores, USMLE scores as reported in their transcripts, and final rank score were used to calculate correlation coefficients amongst the variables. For applicants who took the COMLEX instead of the USMLE, a conversion factor of (score x 0.24) + 67.97 was used for our analyses. Linear correlation and regression analyses as well as descriptive statistics were used for analysis. This study was IRB exempt. Results: 396 interviews were conducted over 4 years. Mean interview scores were similar among the 4 years (ANOVA, p=0.29). Mean USMLE scores were also similar (mean 212, standard deviation 17.3, p=0.36). The correlation coefficient for interview score and rank position was -0.87 with an r-squared of 0.75. The correlation coefficient between USMLE Step 1 score and rank position was -0.32 with an r-squared of 0.10. The correlation coefficient for interview score and USMLE Step 1 score was 0.34, with an r-squared of 0.12. Conclusion: USMLE Step 1 score accounts for only 12% of the variance in interview scores and 10% of the variance in rank position. The interview is the most important determinant of rank position on the EM match list. Future studies will determine if the measures that predict a successful applicant to the match also predict success as a resident.","eng     Congresses     Overall     Acad Emerg Med. 2013 May;20 Suppl 1:S4-367. doi: 10.1111/acem.12115.

Due to medico-legal concerns, medical students are often restricted from documenting in the EMR. Therefore, prior note-writing experiences for incoming interns are variable, and often inadequate. Studies have demonstrated improvements in student documentation through use of a structured rubrics to improve feedback. A curriculum was created to educate pediatric interns on best practices and improve their documentation. METHODS: A novel rubric that identified important components of an inpatient progress note was created containing 13 items scored 0 (not present), 1 (needs improvement), or 2 (present) in six categories: Clinical Data, Assessment, Problem List, Medical Decision Making, Disposition, and Style. Possible scores ranged from 0-26. Interrater reliability between residents was excellent (ICC=0.78). Interns were introduced to the rubric in June 2016. During inpatient rotations, interns received monthly structured feedback from chief residents using the rubric. To evaluate whether the educational intervention improved documentation, all resident progress notes on July 10 and December 10 from 2015 and 2016 were assessed using the rubric by three senior residents who were blinded to authorship and date. One-tailed t-tests were performed on the mean scores amongst groups. RESULTS: Mean overall note score was 22 with wide variation (range: 14-26). No baseline differences between groups note writing mean score in July existed (control 21.5, intervention 21.9, p=0.25). No change in the control group scores between July and December was detected (21.5, 21.5, p=0.47). The intervention group showed improvements in documentation that approached statistical significance (21.9, 22.8 p=0.06).

However, cost-awareness is generally not emphasized in traditional residency curricula. Novel methods are needed to provide costawareness in a time efficient manner. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Internal Medicine interns, residents, Faculty and Yale School of Medicine third year students at three Yaleaffiliated teaching hospitals in Connecticut. DESCRIPTION: The Interactive Cost-Awareness Report (I-CARE) follows a traditional, Morning Report style teaching session run by a Chief Resident, where the diagnostic workup of a patient is discussed in a 1 hour didactic session. I-CARE takes place over a 4 day period every fourth week. One hour each day is provided for each level of training: medical students, interns and sub-interns, residents, and lastly, attending physicians. Those planned to participate in a later session are prohibited observing the trainee sessions, however all trainees are present to observe the attending physician session. Following the initial case presentation, trainees can inquire of the Chief Resident for further information in an effort to make a diagnosis. Additional history and/or physical exam maneuvers not included in the initial presentation (such as travel history, dermatographism, straight leg raise) have no associated cost and are free to the group of trainees should they be specifically requested. Laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging, and diagnostic procedures can also be requested, and the actual patient charge from our institution for that item is recorded by the Chief Resident in real time. These charges are blinded to the participants at the time of the exercise. The actual charges for each group's diagnostic workup are recorded and shared in a friendly competition across training levels and training sites. EVALUATION: Anonymous, voluntary survey of all participants and comparison of expenditures by training level. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Interns, residents and attending physicians were asked to complete the survey. Thirty-seven surveys were returned (39 % response rate). Response was overwhelmingly positive, with 31 respondents (84 %) identifying the SBP case as 'an overall improvement' to Morning Report. Using a 10 point Likert Scale, survey respondents rated the educational quality of the I-CARE case 8.57 and the educational quality of the prior morning report format 6.81 (p<0.001). Narrative responses from survey respondents were also positive. (Fig. 1) Sampling of the first five cases revealed 100 % accuracy of diagnosis by the attending physician group, 60 % accuracy by residents and interns and 50 % accuracy by medical students. Furthermore, dichotomous t-test was performed (Excel 2010, Redmond, WA) to determine difference in expenditures. The attending physician group spent less on average than non-attending participants ($1027.45 vs $4264.00, p=0.02). This difference persisted with medical students excluded from the analysis ($1027.45 vs $3962.80, p=0.03). The I-CARE provides for immediate inclusion of cost-awareness and enhances Systems-based Practice education in an Internal Medicine Residency Program with minimal additional resources by using a pre-existing educational conference. The I-CARE is easy and quick to implement, and the preliminary results show a popular cost-awareness educational experience.","Suppl. 1     Ab6zp     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The aim of our study was to develop and validate an objective and procedure specific tool to assess the quality of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)- Prostatectomy Assessment and Competence Evaluation (PACE). Materials and Methods: A multi-institutional collaboration developed and validated PACE using 56 de-identified RARP videos. and content validation of PACE was performed by deconstruction of RARP into seven key domains utilizing the Delphi methodology. Proficiency in each domain was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale. The reliability and construct validation of PACE were then assessed utilizing de-identified videos performed by practicing surgeons from the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative, and trainee surgeons. Consensus for each domain was defined as achieving a content validity index (CVI) ?0.75. Reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation (ICC) and construct validation was assessed using a mixed linear model accounting for multiple ratings on the same video. Results: Seven main domains are rated with 5 anchors according to surgical proficiency (Figure). Consensus was reached after 3 rounds on wording, relevance of skills assessed, and concordance between the score assigned and the skill assessed. ICC ?0.4 was achieved for all domains. The expert group outperformed trainees in all domains but reached statistical significance in bladder drop (4.5 versus 3.4, p = 0.002), preparation of the prostate (4.4 vs. 3.2, p < 0.0001), seminal vesicles and posterior plane dissection (8.3 vs. 6.8, p = 0.03) and neurovascular bundle preservation (4.1 vs 2.4, p < 0.0001). Trainees included chief residents and fellows which may limit demonstration of wider variation in proficiency. Conclusions: PACE is a structured, procedure-specific and reliable tool that objectivelymeasures surgical performance during RARP.

METHODS: Final-year Canadian-trained residents in general surgery were asked to complete the survey. The survey explored chief residents' career plans for the following year and whether or not they would independently perform various procedures, some general surgical, and others now considered within the domain of the subspecialties. RESULTS: Sixty-four residents (71%) completed the survey. Twenty percent planned to undertake a rural surgical practice, 17% an urban community practice, and 55% had confirmed fellowships. Most residents (>90%) expressed comfort with basic general surgical procedures. However, residents were less comfortable with subspecialty procedures that are still performed by general surgeons in many rural practices. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of graduating general surgery residents are choosing subspecialty fellowship training over proceeding directly to practice. Those choosing a rural or community practice are likely to feel ill prepared to replace existing surgeons.","Gillman, Lawrence M     Vergis, Ashley     eng     Am J Surg. 2013 Jun;205(6):752-7. doi: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.01.017.

As training programs move toward a competency-based training model, we need to utilize objective assessment tools and set validated standards of competency. In this study, we assessed the technical skill of urology residents performing a basic fURS skill task to determine ways to objectively assess performance and to set valid standards of competency METHODS: After REB approval, senior urology residents and faculty endourologists from across Canada were asked to perform a standardized fURS task (flexible ureterorenoscopy + repositioning of lower pole stones) on a fURS simulator (Cook Medical) using standardized equipment. All performances were video-recorded and blindly scored by both endourology experts and crowd-sourcing methods (CSATS) using a validated fURS rating tool. Resident and faculty scores by both expert and CSATS raters were compared. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v24. RESULTS: A total of 44 participants (40 chief residents, 4 faculty) completed testing of which complete assessment data was available for 21 participants at the time of abstract submission. All residents reported having performed at least 25-50 fURS cases with 83% having performed over 50 fURS cases. All faculty participants had performed >500 fURS cases. Comparing residents to faculty, mean time to completion (sec) was 339s vs 158s (p=0.046) respectively. As assessed by blinded experts, all faculty participants were rated as safe to perform independently with a mean score (range 4 to 20) of 16.8 while only 56% of residents were rated as safe to perform independently with a mean score of 12.6 (p=0.04). The mean CSATS scores for residents and faculty was 12.4 vs 13.6 (p=0.38), respectively. Expert assessment scores correlated well with time to completion (r=-0.872, p<0.001), Pass/Fail ratings (r=0.859, p<0.001) and CSATS scores (r=0.798 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: On a standardized, simulated flexible ureterorenoscopy task, faculty endourologists outperformed graduating urology residents in Canada as assessed by expert raters using a validated fURS assessment tool. Less than 60% of residents were rated as safe to perform independently. Crowd-sourced assessment (CSATS) scores correlated very well with expert assessments. Once all assessment data is available, we will now be able to set validated standards for fURS competency using both norm- and criterion-referenced methods.","Suppl.

RESULTS: Surveys were completed by representatives from 55 programs (response rate, 71.4%) in 2005 to 2006, 60 programs (75.9%) in 2006 to 2007, and 74 programs (93.7%) in 2007 to 2008. Nearly all chief residents reported receiving adequate clinical experience in commonly treated disease sites, such as breast and genitourinary malignancies; and commonly performed procedures, such as three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Clinical experience in extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy increased over time (p < 0.001), whereas clinical experience in endovascular brachytherapy (p <0.001) decreased over time. The distribution of gynecologic and prostate brachytherapy cases remained stable, while clinical case load in breast brachytherapy increased (p = 0.006). A small but significant percentage of residents reported receiving inadequate clinical experience in pediatrics, seeing 10 or fewer pediatric cases during the course of residency. Procedures involving higher capital costs, such as particle beam therapy and intraoperative radiotherapy, and infrequent clinical use, such as head and neck brachytherapy, were limited to a minority of institutions. Most residency programs associated with at least one satellite facility have incorporated resident rotations into their clinical training, and the majority of residents at these programs find them valuable experiences.

Residents required frequent reminders by both GME staff and program directors to complete duty hours, required health screenings, and clinical documentation. Attendance at noon conference was low despite multiple reminders and efforts to improve lecture quality. In order to improve adherence to these tasks we created a resident citizenship score that was used to distribute sick (jeopardy) coverage. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Our program is a 67 person internal medicine residency based in 2 community teaching hospitals. Residents are assigned jeopardy coverage in blocks of 4 consecutive days during electives. Traditionally blocks were distributed evenly to residents throughout the academic year. DESCRIPTION: In AY 2016-2017 we instituted a global citizenship score that included credit for timely duty hour entry, completion of medical records, compliance with administrative requests, and noon conference attendance. For each of these tasks, residents needed to reach a specific threshold in order to receive credit. For example, residents needed to have fewer than 5 pending discharge summaries to receive credit for completion of medical records, and attend > 70% conference to receive credit for noon conference while on a floor rotation. Duty hour entry and attendance were tracked through our web-based learning management system. Medical record completion was monitored by medical records staff. GME staff and chief residents compiled this data to form a composite citizenship score every 4 weeks. EVALUATION: In the first 4 months AY2015-16, 67 residents attended 2381 hours of conference. In the same period in AY 2016-17, 67 residents attended 2840 hours of conference (p < .001 for difference). After 6 months of implementation 100% of residents entered duty hours without reminders; while in AY2015-16 multiple email and in-person reminders were required. After implementation, no residents had > 5 discharge summaries pending or any records > 28 days old, and 4% of residents had any evaluations incomplete after > 90 days. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Encouraging adherence to administrative tasks is challenging. By reframing completion of these tasks as professionalism and linking less professional behavior to a minor penalty - additional jeopardy call - we increased compliance. Although compiling the citizenship score required some time by GME support staff and chief residents, this time was partially offset by decreased time spend in reminders.","Suppl. 2     Go7oj     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Our objectives were to: 1) assess stakeholder perspectives on residents' needs and how well those needs are met by the current curriculum and; 2) assess residents' perspectives on their knowledge, needs, and expectations of the rotation. Methods: We conducted an iterative assessment of perspectives of faculty and learners on the previous resident rotation in adolescent medicine. Faculty interviews included the pediatric residency director, chief residents, outpatient clinic site directors, and the course director and staff for the adolescent medicine rotation. We assessed where residents receive formal education about adolescent health, as well as the content and quality of that information. We then reviewed adolescent health content of the residents' outpatient curricula and experiences, including the adolescent medicine rotation, outpatient continuity clinic, and the residency noon conference series. We asked faculty to discuss strengths and challenges of the rotation, and identify areas for update. Next, we developed a tool to compare entering interns versus graduating residents with respect to knowledge about reproductive health. We asked residents to self-rate comfort and competence in common adolescent medicine scenarios. Results: Faculty interviews revealed that residents are exposed to adolescent medicine in many settings. Their perceived needs included contraceptive/gynecologic education and a focus on adolescent medicine content for the Pediatric Board exam. Faculty also noted that pediatric residents are particularly challenged by patients with substance use issues and those in need of gynecologic exams. Faculty identified several areas for improvement: residents 1) spent redundant time on inpatient rounds, 2) lacked materials focused on positive youth development, and 3) needed new community opportunities. We also found that rotation materials were disorganized and redundant. Through the pediatrics residency program, we surveyed 23 incoming interns and 18 graduating residents. The graduating residents felt more comfortable and competent than their first year counterparts in caring for adolescent patients. Program graduates answered the reproductive health knowledge questions more accurately than the first year residents, but there were notable gaps in their knowledge, e.g, about emergency contraception. The curriculum content assessment varied widely between the first and third year respondents. Interns reported broad interests in adolescent health ranging from history-taking to functional pain syndromes, whereas graduating residents felt well prepared, yet desired more reproductive health content. Based on these results, we made a number of changes to the rotation, including an electronic format organized by the ACGME requirements. We added online reproductive health content with self-study time in place of lower-yield activities, and a resident self-reflection exercise before and after the rotation. Curricular changes are now being implemented and evaluated. We plan a qualitative study of residents' pre- and post-rotation self-reflection data, and will examine adolescent medicine experiences of residents outside the adolescent medicine rotation. Conclusions: It is important to continually update institutional curricula in adolescent medicine as the field of adolescent medicine - and our learners - evolve.","Suppl.

In colorectal surgery (CRS), this has resulted in an increased number of CRS residencies. However, many CRS and GS residencies interact. The effect of a CRS residency on GS residents has not been examined, specifically regarding caseloads. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of a new CRS residency on a well-established, university-based GS residency. The primary endpoint was GS case volume before and after the CRS residency was started. A secondary endpoint was whether the CRS residency changed GS in-service exam (ABSITE) scores. Methods: In 2005 a new CRS residency was started at our institution. Case logs of graduating GS chief residents from 2002-2010 were reviewed from the ACGME electronic Oplog. Total gastrointestinal (GI) cases, including large alimentary tract, small bowel and anorectal cases (as defined by the ACGME) were compared preceding (2002- 2005) and following (2005-2010) introduction of the CRS residency using Poisson regression. In addition, ABSITE scores in the GI section of PGY 3 to 5 residents, pre- vs. post-CRS residency, were examined using binomial regression. Results: GS residents performed more total GI cases before the CRS residency. Although small bowel case volume was maintained, there was a significant drop in large alimentary and, in particular, anorectal cases after starting the CRS residency (Table). GI ABSITE scores showed a marked improvement since the CRS residency began (Table). Conclusions: Since addition of our CRS residency, GS residents have had a significant reduction in total GI case volume, most notably in anorectal surgery. Although this could partially be attributable to adoption of the 80-hour workweek and alteration of chief resident service allocation, the CRS residency does seem to have impacted GS caseloads. In contrast, an improvement in the GI ABSITE scores was seen. This could be related to a new academic curriculum in our colorectal division to meet the higher standard in CRS residency training, as well as dedication of the CRS resident to teach in their chosen field. The divergent findings of this study raise important educational issues which merit further investigation.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed the Health Disparities Track (HDT) for the Tinsley Harrison Internal Medicine Residency Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). UAB is a non-profit, 1400 bed quaternary care center in Birmingham, Alabama. UAB provides a university-based training program for 118 Internal Medicine (IM) residents who, during the 2014-2015 academic year, were 85 % White, 6 % Asian/Indian, 5 % Black, and 4 % Hispanic.

We used Kern's six-step model for curricular design including problem identification, targeted needs assessment, definition of goals and objectives, implementation, use of varied educational strategies, evaluation and feedback. We developed goals and objectives in accordance with the Society of General Internal Medicine Health Disparities Task Force recommendation for disparities education. We surveyed residents to determine their preferred methods of instruction when learning to care for patients of cultures other than their own. Based on results, we developed didactic, clinical, and experiential learning content for our curriculum. For didactics, we used publically available resources and local expertise to create a 2-year lecture series on bias and discrimination, social and environmental determinants of health, patient-provider interactions, language and acculturation, disparities in research, special populations, and advocacy. For clinical experience, we partnered with a local clinic offering free care to uninsured patients in Birmingham, M Power Ministries Health Center. Based on clinic availability, we assigned nine residents to one-quarter of their continuity clinic time at M Power; the remaining three-quarters of their continuity clinic time was spent at a previously assigned UAB clinic site. Finally, for experiential leaning, we tasked residents with structured community exploration and reflective writing. We evaluated feasibility of curricular implementation as well as curricular outcomes at the program and resident levels. Program outcomes included number of didactic and clinic sessions delivered. Resident outcomes included reaction (compliance with assignments and interest in completing a second year of the curriculum), learning (delivery of a didactic conference on health disparities and creation of a resource guide for services available to low-income patients in the community), and behavior change (commitments to change and pre-post-test preparedness to care for patients of a different culture). EVALUATION: Sixteen (21%) IM residents volunteered to participate in the first year of the HDT. Feasibility was high, evidenced by successful implementation of all curricular components with no required funding. Program outcomes included delivery of 4 didactic and 84 resident clinic sessions. Overall resident reaction was positive (increased participation from 16 to 25 in the second year of the curriculum). Compliance with educational activities was higher for HDT residents assigned to the clinic experience than for those who were not (59 % vs 33 %, p = 0.07). HDT residents disseminated knowledge to their peers through a 1-h lecture on social and environmental determinants of health, bias and discrimination, and patient-provider interactions. They created a resource guide of 22 medical, dental, psychological, and social services availa le in the community. Fifteen HDT residents made 20 commitments to change with themes including communication, community resources, barriers to care, bias and discrimination, and patient perspective. HDT residents achieved increased preparedness to care for patients of cultures other than their own (somewhat unprepared to somewhat prepared, p = 0.025). DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: A Health Disparities Track was feasible to design and implement. Residents who participated in the HDT showed positive reaction, learning, and behavior change. Facilitators to implementation included supportive program leadership, two chief resident champions, use of publically available resources and a community clinic with aligning priorities. Barriers included availability of resident time and program sustainability. In spite of these barriers, HDT expansion in the second year suggests success in implementation and overall satisfaction with the program.","Suppl. 2     Ei0yl     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The role of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) in the education of emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians is currently not well-defined. This study explores the characteristics of EM resident physician HEMS training. Methods: An anonymous survey of chief resident physicians in all 2008 US Accreditation Committee for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) approved EM residency training programs was conducted using an electronic mail-linked survey. Multiple choice, Likert scale (1 no value, 9 exceptional value), and short answer responses were used. Queries encompassed program demographics, air medical services orientation and curriculum, safety education, and the value of the HEMS experience during residency training. Results: Sixty-six chief residents responded from 135 EM residency programs in 23 states (49% response rate). Of those programs, 7.7% offered no HEMS training opportunity, 15.4% had a mandatory HEMS curriculum (mandatory), 73.8% had an optional or elective rotation (optional), and 3.1% offered moonlighting opportunities only (moonlight). Few programs had flight shift hours built into the EM schedule (27.9%), most flight shifts lasted 8-12 hours (73.9%), and most residents had ?25 total flights during training (85.2%). Few programs utilized a formal air medical services curriculum (36.2%), but most required a safety orientation (72.9%). Mandatory residents felt adequately trained to fly (90%) as compared to optional (46.5%) and moonlighting residents (50.0%), and reported a higher value to the program (6.67 vs. 4.41 vs. 5.0). Conclusions: HEMS training in EM residency programs varies widely, with most programs offering an optional or elective rotation without a formal curriculum. EM residents who participated in mandatory HEMS training perceived a higher value to the training than other resident physicians.","eng     Congresses     Overall     Acad Emerg Med. 2010 May;17 Suppl 1:S1-212. doi: 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2010.00743.x.

It is a valuable teaching technique which provides opportunities for residents to learn and practice skills without affecting patient care. Simulation allows residents to practice skills in a deliberate fashion with clear objectives, feedback from someone more expert in the skill set and with proper evaluation, the ability to advance to the next level of skill. This process of deliberate practice allows the resident to focus on their areas of strength and weaknesses. It affords them the opportunity to selfassess and therefore begin the process of life-long learning. At our institution, residents voiced an interest in spending more time practicing in the simulation center. Deliberate practice sessions were developed by the chief residents based on junior resident self assessment. Methods: General surgery residents were asked to perform a personal needs assessment for technical skills. It was felt that as adult learners, if they were able to identify their own learning needs they would be highly invested in the learning process. Their responses were used to create a series of sessions held in the simulation center. A senior resident and the simulation center education staff organized all sessions. The sessions followed the American College of Surgeons/Association of Program Directors in Surgery (ACS/APDS) surgical skills curriculum, and were modified as needed for each session. A novel session was created for sessions without an appropriate ACS/APDS session. Attending physicians were present for all sessions proctoring and providing contemporaneous feedback to the residents. Results: Over the span of six months, five sessions were developed. One session a trocar placement lab, utilized a torso box trainer containing a watermelon under the simulated skin as the abdominal wall. The junior residents were able to place the ports for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with repetitive practice if needed under the guidance and coaching of the senior residents. Wet labs were developed for many of the sessions. In one session, porcine carotids and jugulars were used to perform closures of arteriotomies with a vein patch. Discussion: All sessions were well received by the residents and attendings. Resident self-assessment led to focused deliberate practice sessions. Residents were highly invested in the sessions and given the immediate feedback for skill correction and advancement. It is often difficult to garner attending participation in simulation sessions due to their busy clinical schedules. However it was clear that attending physicians were more eager to attend sessions when residents sought their participation. Perhaps it was the drive of the residents to further their own education that energized the attendings, making it easy to garner more than expected involvement. Or that they could begin lessons with the residents that would continue into the operating room. The responsibility of the sessions will be handed down to new chief residents each year. Feedback and residents assessments will be tracked over time to determine the impact of this innovative teaching tool.","L71480130     2014-07-21 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Recent graduates report dissatisfaction with exposure in these areas, with most training didactic rather than practical. We describe a resident-run safety council as a means to engage residents as active drivers of safety and QI. PURPOSE: The Duke Pediatric Residency Safety Council (PRSC) fosters a culture of safety at Duke Children's Hospital. In this resident-driven model, trainees identify safety issues and receive hands-on training in systematically reviewing errors and using QI methodology to address concerns. DESCRIPTION: Established in 2013, the PRSC is supported by chief residents and faculty mentors. The PRSC organizes multidisciplinary morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences using an open-format, standardized template. Participants use Learning from Defects to identify systems issues that lead to errors and to generate action items, or specific areas for safety improvement. The PRSC also reviews resident-written patient safety event reports to generate further action items. The PRSC has organized over 35 M&M conferences to date, covering topics such as transitions of patient care and cognitive biases in diagnosis. Over 40 action items have been completed, leading to sustained advancements in patient safety, such as implementation of a hospital-wide program to prevent inadvertent discontinuation of home medications during in-patient stays. Resident surveys demonstrate significant improvement in resident perception of Duke Children s culture of safety since inception of the PRSC. Review of patient safety event reports and resulting action items have also increased non-member resident participation and have made the Department of Pediatrics a leader in this regard. CONCLUSION: The PRSC models successful involvement of trainees in system-based patient safety and QI, fostering growth of a robust patient safety culture within Duke Children s. Such involvement can help to satisfy ACGME core competencies and develop leaders in the area of patient safety and QI.","L617344520     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

While this rotation is rated consistently as one of the best experiences of residency, little is known of its impact on professional skills development or on postgraduate career choices. The objectives of this studywere: (1) to evaluate the development of professional skills during the ACR rotation (2) to assess the value and usefulness of these skills and (3) to determine the impact of the ACR experience on the decision to pursue a career in academic medicine. METHODS: Of the 64 identified graduates of the Primary Care Track who completed residency training from 1992-2008, 50 (78% response rate) completed the 6 page, 28-item mailed survey. 4 graduates were excluded due to lack of contact information. Areas addressed in the survey included current practice type, the effect of ACR time on professional skill development, the value of certain professional skills, and the impact of ACR time on postgraduate and current career choice. The questionnaire utilized several different scales including a Likert scale, ranking and open-ended questions. Initial non-responders were sent a second questionnaire by mail. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis to compare dichotomous variables. RESULTS: At the time of survey completion, 64% of our graduates were in primary care internal medicine, 10% hospitalists, 16% subspecialists (mostly geriatrics and HIV) and 10% in non-clinical settings. Overall, 82% of graduates agreed that being ACR was one of the most formative experiences of their residency. Residents identified didactic teaching, leadership, and independent learning as the top three professional skills that they developed during their ACR rotation, with leadership and independent learning as two out of the top three skills most valuable in their current career. 72% of graduate's first jobs were in academics; three quarters as clinician-educators. Of respondents, 83% of graduates completed an ACR rotation and 17% did not. Graduates who did ACR time were more likely to be in academics at the time of survey completion compared to graduates who did not do the ACR rotation (59% vs 36%, p=.3). They were also less likely to have left academics (21% vs 50%, p=.2). 91% of graduates in academic positions (compared with graduates in nonacademic positions) felt that the ACR rotation reinforced their desire to pursue an academic career (91% vs 31%, p=.0001). 86% of graduates in academics felt that the ACR rotation impacted their career choice compared to 43% of graduates in nonacademic's (86% vs 43%,p=.006). 6% experienced a complete shift in career choice by pursuing clinician educator positions after serving as ACR. CONCLUSION: AstructuredambulatoryAssistantChiefResident rotation was found to develop skills in teaching, leadership and independent learningthatproved valuable in the careers ofour graduates.While only6% attribute their time as ACR as resulting in a complete career change into academics, thosewho endedup in academics rated theirACRtime as being highly influential in their career choice.

The ultimate goal of handover is to ensure patients safety, thus, its standardization enables concise relay of information across team members. Many factors is contributing to efficient and safe handovers such as: organization of the whole process of handover, insure presence of protected time, standard systems and training for all staff. Different systems of communication have been developed to achieve effective and safe handover such as SBAR and IPASS, however still there is an area of improvement for the patients' information handover. Purpose: To study the completion of patient information during handover using SBAR modality at the time of residents endorsement. To identify frequent missing elements in the residents handover. To study the organization of the whole handover process. Methods: An observational study was conducted in Pediatric Department of Hamad General Hospital. The observational tool was structured to examine the contents of the oral handover using SBAR method, which was filled by chief residents. the observation was done at the time of handover between morning team and the on call team. It included the organization of the handover, 9 essential elements conveyed in SBAR format and flow of the endorsement throughout different team levels. Results: There were 26 endorsement observations collected from different types of endorsement (Junior to Junior, Senior to Junior, Junior to Senior, Senior to Senior, Senior to Fellow, and Fellow to Fellow). 30.8% of the endorsement comes from Senior to Senior, 23.1% from Senior to Junior, 19.2% Junior to Junior, 15.4% Junior to Senior; while Senior to Fellow, Fellow to Fellow, and undescribed had 3.8% each. 50% of the residents' handovers had completed 100% the 9 elements of endorsement using SBAR, while 35% covered 75% of the SBAR element in endorsement. The commonest missing elements were patients' demographics and location (23%) followed by situation awareness (19%). Organization of the whole handover process was 38% of more than 4 that is very good and only 12% of 1, which is poor organization. Conclusions: The majority of the residents' handovers were inclusive of the 9 elements of SBAR. An extra important element was observed in 12% of the endorsements, which is read back by the receiver; an element not part of the SBAR modality. The study was highlighted areas for improvement in SBAR content. Adding read back by receiver = (R) to the SBAR may ensure that crucial patients' information is well understood by the receiving team. Creating a modified handover modality in form of SBARR may greatly improve endorsement safety and quality.","L621381166     2018-03-28 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

(2) Analyze results using this technique on 42 consecutive patients. Methods: A retrospective case series was performed on all patients from 2008 to 2014 undergoing an en bloc osteotomy rhinoplasty for treatment of a deviated dorsum by a single facial plastic surgeon. Pictures were captured pre- and postoperatively. For each patient, a facial plastic surgeon, an otolaryngology chief resident, and a layperson evaluated and graded the photos using the Kienstra-Sherris-Kern Classification of Nasal Dorsal Deformities criteria-width, deviation, concavity/ convexity, projection. They were also asked if the operation resulted in improvement, no change, or worsening in the overall appearance of the patient. Adjusted 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Forty-two patients underwent en bloc osteotomy from 2008 to 2014.

Renewed attention has focused on maintaining wellness and supporting trainees with mental illness after the alleged deaths from suicide of two IM interns in 2014. Our objectives were to: 1) Change the culture at our institution and 2) Equip our chiefs, residents and core faculty with skills to recognize struggling residents and knowledge of resources available. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Large, urban academic medical center. 16 chief residents, 74 residents and 6 faculty participated in program DESCRIPTION: We instituted two experiential learning activities to change our residency's culture around the approach to burnout and mental illness. Over the 2014-2015 academic year we included a struggling colleague case in the established intern and PGY-2 OSCEs and instituted a group three-station OSCE on struggling residents for the chief residents in our IM program. The learning objectives were that learners would 1) understand their role in identifying and assisting struggling colleagues 2) recognize problembehaviors, 3) effectively discuss concerns with colleagues who may be impaired and, 4) identify available resources. The intern and PGY-2 OSCE case portrayed a colleague who struggled with depression and alcohol abuse. The station involved 10 min with the standardized learner, then immediate feedback and discussion with faculty. The three-station group OSCE for the chiefs was preceded by a discussion of the impaired physician and the epidemiology of substance abuse, burnout and mental illness in our profession and chief residents' role in identifying and assisting struggling trainees. Cases included standardized trainees who evidenced alcohol abuse, depression, and adjustment disorder and who had varied insight and willingness to accept help. EVALUATION: Both housestaff and chief residents noted the value of this learning experience. Of the housestaff (41 interns and 33 PGY-2 s) who participated in the OSCE, one-third felt unprepared for the case. Most struggled with roles and boundary issues discussing concerns with peers rather than patients. All 16 chief residents who completed the group OSCE valued reviewing their role and learning approaches to these conversations. Themes expressed at 1 month follow up included: support for group OSCE, importance of seeing alternate approaches to these conversations, new perspective on skills needed for their job and the relevance of available resources. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Instituting experiential learning activities with chiefs, residents and faculty on mental illness and burnout can generate greater awareness of the problem, promote skills in approaching these situations and effectively disseminate resources. Learners valued the opportunity to discuss resources directly with faculty and understand program's supportive environment. Moreover, it demonstrated leadership's awareness of these issues and reinforced efforts at culture change.","Suppl. 2     Ei0yl     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

We plan to evaluate change in knowledge using paired t-tests. Additionally, descriptive statistics will be used to report time for module completion, satisfaction and confidence levels. Results: During the focus group sessions, we received detailed and critical feedback on the module. The majority of attendees reported limited exposure to patients with pre-pubertal bleeding during residency, and the modules provided a useful learning tool to review the topic. Focus group attendees noted the following deficiencies in the modules: (1) poor image quality, (2) inadequate details on both management and treatment of prepubertal bleeding, and (3) need to expand the volume of exam questions to reinforce learning. Revisions were then made to the module. The module is currently being viewed by our residents and final evaluation tools will be completed by November 2016. We will analyze survey results in January 2017 and report our findings. Conclusions: We have developed an eLearning module to improve education of Ob-Gyn residents in the evaluation and management of prepubertal vaginal bleeding. This also has the potential to teach learners at other institutions with similar barriers to education in pediatric and adolescent gynecology.","L616240623     2017-05-23 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The DOTE was created to provide personalized, directed feedback about teaching strengths and areas for improvement, replacing a numeric grading system with infrequent comments previously used only after formal conferences. METHODS: The DOTE was implemented in Aug 2015. Resident and faculty learners can access it through the residency's online learning management system and complete it for any resident teaching context. Completion requests are also assigned by chief residents after resident-led noon conferences. Rates of completion were followed for 15 months. A pre/post implementation survey questionnaire (4-point Likert scale) was sent to all residents (n=92) at the beginning and end of the 2015/16 academic year to assess perceptions of feedback about teaching skills. Chisquared was used to compare proportions of agree/strongly agree between pre/post groups. RESULTS: Residents received 2.7 DOTEs/year on average; 68% of residents received e1 DOTE. Most (87%) addressed Power- Point teaching. Survey response rates were 67% pre-DOTE (42% PGY1, 24% PGY2, 27% PGY3) and 49% post-DOTE (24% PGY1, 44% PGY2, 31% PGY3). Of post-DOTE responders, 38% had received e1 DOTE. Comparing responders who had received e1 DOTE to those who had not, 47% v. 54% felt they received timely feedback (p=0.7) while 71% v. 46% received useful feedback (p=0.1). The proportion of all responders reporting timely feedback pre/post increased from 26% to 51% (p<0.01) and useful feedback increased from 23% to 56% (p<0.01). Resident awareness of individual teaching strengths remained similar (65% v 75%, p=0.25) among all responders, while PGY1 awareness of teaching strengths increased from 54% to 81% (p=0.1). CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend toward improved perception of usefulness of feedback about resident teaching skills following DOTE implementation. More work is needed to increase use in informal teaching scenarios and evaluate the impact on learners.","L617344027     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

With twice daily shift changes for physician and nurses, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology introduced a new interdisciplinary team transition of care system. Initial anecdotal feedback suggested that the handoff process was suboptimal and communication efforts could be improved. The purpose of the study was to evaluate attitudes of faculty, residents, and nursing staff about a transition of care system and identify opportunities to improve the safety and quality of care involving antepartum, postpartum, and gynecology patients. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was administered to physicians and nurses participating in the new handoff system. The results were analyzed to identify opportunities for improvement. RESULTS: Responses were analyzed from 21 members of the interdisciplinary team. 47% of the respondents found the transition of care system helpful. 55% felt their goals for handoffs were accomplished. All respondents reported importance in addressing updates on patient plans of care and anticipated discharge dates. Content of handoffs should focus on the acute and critically ill patients. The attending physician, chief resident, and nursing team leaders should participate in the handoff process. CONCLUSION: Differences in goals and content focus between physicians and nurses contributed to suboptimal communication and handoffs. Identifying the deficits allows opportunities for improvement in transitioning care and ultimately the safety and quality of care provided to patients. Participation in the process should include faculty physicians, chief residents, and nursing leaders.","Suppl. 1     Ew7pd     20i     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

P. and Martino, M. and Arthur, K. and Dunlap, S.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000381064700377,English,,,"Introduction: Preventable hospital admissions for heart failure (HF) patients (pts) continues to significantly impact Public Health expenditures. Analysis of CMS database shows readmissions for HF patients continues to be high at 1.35 million at a total cost of $1.7billion. To decrease readmissions, we formed a multi-disciplinary team for the care of these pts at our urban, inner-city, academic medical center. The team was comprised of the Heart Failure Medical Director, Telemetry and CCU RNs, Pharmacists, Nurse Educators and Managers, and Chief Residents. We joined American Heart Association's GetWith the Guidelines Program and instituted standardized Admission and Discharge Order Sets, HF nursing care plans, door signage for fluid restriction, and discharged indigent pts with two weeks of medications. We also instituted 60 minutes of In-Patient Education, developed See A Nurse Now program in the out-patient Advanced HF Treatment Center (AHFTC), arranged for follow-up within 7 days of discharge and for administration of IV diuretics in either the AHFTC or at home by Home Health Care(HHC) RNs. Moreover, we created 2 HF coordinator positions to manage the above measures. Barriers in self-care often lead to readmissions. Symptom burden and misconceptions regarding HF self-care are reasons for non-adherence. Despite information and education while hospitalized, HF patients do not retain information due to memory loss and poor concentration. HHC has been identified as an approach to overcome this. Recent studies have shown that HF pts with HHC of at least 22 days duration had significantly lower rates of readmission than those without HHC. Methods: Review of records at our urban, inner-city academic medical center showed a 19% readmission rate for FiscalYear (FY) 2015, down from 28% in FY 2010. This prompted us to review patients being discharged with HHC; we found only 34% of HF patients were discharged with HHC. We then conducted a 5-week quality improvement project to identify reasons for underutilization of HHC at our institution. Patients discharged from the hospital following a HF exacerbation following in the AHFTC were provided a questionnaire to elicit why they were not receiving HHC. This tool asked 1) if they currently have HHC, 2)was HHC discussed as an option while hospitalized, 3)what was their reason for declining HHC if they declined, and 4)if they noticed any benefit to HHC if they chose to receive HHC. Results: 44 patients were admitted during the study period; 26 patients (60%) responded. Of these 26, 17 did not have HHC and, of those, only 7 pts were offered HHC. Conclusion: Our data not only shows underutilization of HHC but that eligible pts are infrequently asked if they would like HHC. This creates a possible opportunity for decreasing HF readmissions in our population.","Suppl.

There have been attempts at assessing surgical skills but none that have been adapted to all programs. One of the primary goals of residency training is to develop confident surgeons. Our objective was to identify the current perceptions and attitudes of chief residents (CR) in regards to their training, comfort level with future practice and career interests. Methods: A 15-question online survey was sent to residency program directors and coordinators to distribute to their chief residents. Comfort level with procedures was graded as very comfortable, comfortable, neutral, uncomfortable or very uncomfortable. Results: A total of 42 Chief Residents (CR) responded to the survey. There were several skills and procedures that more than 20% of CRs rated they were uncomfortable with. 24% of CR were uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with cystocele repair with only 45% of residents stating they were comfortable or very comfortable performing cystocele repair. Other procedures that had > 20% level responding as uncomfortable were open radical prostatectomy (24%), cystoprostatectomy with neobladder formation (21%), billing and coding (37%). Residents were more comfortable with other FPMRS procedures such as mid-urethral sling (76% comfortable, 12% uncomfortable) and ureteral reimplant with Boari flap (67% comfortable, 12% uncomfortable). The procedures that most CRs rated comfortable with were TURP (100%) and insertion of a multicomponent penile prosthesis (83%). Just over half of CRs (52%) were pursuing a fellowship and themost common fellowships were urologic oncology (27%) and female urology (23%). When asked: ''Are there any aspects of urology that you believe you are ill prepared to deal with independently?'' 50% of the free responses mentioned that they were lacking experience in female urology and reconstructive surgery. Conclusion: Most CRs are comfortable with their training; however 50% of respondents feel that they lack female urology and reconstructive training while almost a quarter of graduating residents do not feel comfortable performing a cystocele repair.

Using modified root cause analyses (RCAs) in monthly resident-run conferences has been suggested as one manner to improve resident Ql exposure and skills. In a previously described patient safety curriculum, an internal medicine PGY3, supervised by a hospitalism leads a modified RCA that focuses on a quality gap encountered on the teaching service. The types of interventions that result from such a conference has not been previously described. Better understanding of topics discussed in such conferences can help direct future Ql curriculum development and highlight opportunities for house staff. Purpose: To describe the nature and success of suggested interventions that were discussed in 18 recent resident-run quality improvement conferences. Description: Individual cases for each QIC were presented monthly. After each QIC, chief residents and hospitalists agreed on the major interventions suggested in a moderated group discussion. In 18 conferences, 48 interventions were identified. These interventions were grouped into 4 broad categories based on a hierarchy of efficacy: educational, reminder systems, design changes (protocol or infrastructure), and design changes (IT based). Implementation status was tracked and the degree to which changes persisted over time was rated as poor, fair, good, or excellent. Cases included a lost guide wire during a code, incorrect medication or dosages, central line infections, missed diagnoses, disclosing errors, poor transitions of care, and poor patient satisfaction. Of 48 interventions identified. 27 (56%) were implemented, but only 15 (31%) persisted in a meaningful way (defined as fair or higher persistence; Table 1). IT design changes, such as electronic medication reconciliation, were few but more likely to be successfully implemented (60%). Protocol design changes, such as mandating talk-back for verbal orders or color coding DNR bracelets, though more commonly recommended were implemented less frequently (35%). The largest number of suggested interventions, 23, were of the educational type, and 16 of these suggestions were implemented. Persistence of these interventions was low, with only 37% showing fair or higher long-term implementation success. Conclusions: Modified RCAs lead by house staff and moderated by hospitatists and chief residents, can lead to many interventions that persist in an organization. As expected, IT design changes were most often successfully implemented. Suggested educational interventions and protocol design changes were implemented less frequently and persisted less robustly. Future surveys of house staff, nurses, and other clinicians will assess whether this Ql program contributes to a culture of safety and quality.","L71753253     2015-02-03 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

We sought to develop and validate a low-cost, high fidelity robotic surgical simulator for the urethrovesical anastomosis component of robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. METHODS: A novel urethrovesical anastomosis simulation model was constructed with silicone molds and a 3D-printed model of the male boney pelvis. Using a DaVinci surgical robot, urology faculty and trainees operated on the simulation. Each participant viewed a 4- minute instructional video and was then was given 12 minutes to complete the simulation. A survey was issued to establish face validity, content validity, and acceptability. Simulation runs were recorded, evaluated by three blinded reviewers, and given a GEARS (global evaluative assessment of robotic skills) and PACE (prostatectomy assessment and competency evaluation) score. The quality of the anastomosis was graded by two reviewers. These factors were compared to robotic experience to establish construct validity. ANOVA statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seventeen participants took part in the initial validation of this model (1 faculty, 4 fellows, 2 chief residents, and 10 residents). Median console experience was 10 years, 4.0 years, 1.5 years, and 0 years for faculty, fellows, chief residents, and residents, respectively. Likert (1-5) scores for face validity, content validity, and acceptability were 3.56 (SD 0.42), 4.17 (SD 0.21), and 4.24 (SD 0.15), respectively. Construct validity was excellent. Mean time to completion, mean percent completion, mean anastomosis inspection score, mean GEARS score, and mean PACE score all correlated to robotic experience (p < 0.01, see table 1). Total material cost was $2.50 per model. CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel high-fidelity, low-cost robotic simulation of the urethrovesical anastomosis. Initial evaluation demonstrates good face validity, content validity, and acceptability. Construct validity is excellent, and the model is able to discern robotic skill level across all levels of training. Further studies are needed to evaluate longitudinal effect of the model on surgical training.","Suppl.

This has prompted several societies including American Cancer Society, USPTF and College of Chest Physicians to publish lung cancer screening guidelines. Given the relatively new recommendations the adoption of these guidelines has been slow and most primary care physicians are not screening their patients as recommendations would suggest. Methods: We piloted a clinical reminder in our Internal Medicine VA primary care clinic to ascertain and attempt to improve screening guideline adherence. Resident education about the guidelines was done, the clinical reminder was turned on in our resident clinic and results were followed for the next 3 months. Results: Before the clinical reminder the resident adherence to guidelines was 60% which increased to 82.2% after 3 months. The accuracy of the clinical reminder was 89.6% with 6 people having screening when not indicated. The majority of residents indicated that only 0-2 minutes were added to each clinical visit and they agreed it was easy to use in our post-intervention survey. Conclusions: Our clinical reminder increased adherence among our Internal Medicine residents by a relative increase of 37%. The pre-intervention adherence was at 60% and is likely much higher than most general PCP populations given academic programs are more likely to be up to date with literature. Our clinical reminder is easy to use and can be piloted further within the general PCP population at the VA medical center. This is an example of a chief resident-driven quality improvement project to bring awareness to the lung cancer screening guidelines to ensure appropriate screening among those that qualify and appropriate non screening among those patients that do not qualify is undertaken.","Et6ak     A5183     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Restricted shift duration may increase the number of patient handoffs (PH), potentially creating a risk of medical errors related to inadequate communication. ICU patients may be especially vulnerable to these types of errors. In this study, we sought to gather data on the PH process in the ICUs of US internal medicine training programs and to understand how these programs have adapted their PH process in response to recent changes in ACGME work hour regulations. Methods: We created an online survey focusing on the characteristics of the PH process. Contact information for every US internal medicine program director was obtained from the FREIDA website. The director was asked to forward the survey link to the chief resident and ICU director most closely associated with the medical ICU at their program's primary training site. Responses were collected anonymously. Results: The survey link was sent to all 397 US internal medicine programs. 104 total responses were received. The majority of respondents were chief residents and ICU directors. Program size varied from less than 40 trainees to greater than 120 and all geographic regions were represented. Greater than 75% of MICUs reported a closed structure, more than 15 beds, utilization of an electronic medical record, and staffing by PGY-1 and 2 residents who serve as the first call for MICU patients. The majority of programs have changed their resident shift schedule in response to ACGME work hour regulations and 57 % have adjusted their PH process. Most programs utilize education on PH, overlapping shifts, and a uniform communication template. However, few programs avoid auto-populated data, perform PH at the bedside, provide supervision of PHs, or provide formal feedback on PHs. Only 14 % of respondents felt their system effectively prepared the incoming resident to assume care of the patients, and 46% felt that PH was a significant source of medical errors. Conclusions: This study suggests that new ACGME regulations have significantly impacted the PH process in the medical ICU. Most programs have adjusted their PH process in response to these regulations, but many still report that PH are a significant source of medical errors, and few programs report utilization of PH characteristics associated with effective communication. This data suggests that a uniform, evidence-based process for conducting PH in the ICU is an important patient safety initiative.

This approach is problematic, however, because it relies heavily on first-hand training of surgical techniques and approaches. Methods of bridging the gap between didactic and clinical orthognathics have been lacking. Recently, the creation and use of computer-simulated orthognathic surgery has started to address this problem and actually shown to benefit surgical trainees. For example, a prospective, randomized, blinded study conducted by Tucker, et al. (2010) demonstrated the use of virtual reality surgical simulation by residents repetitively until reaching specific target criteria, which significantly improved subsequent operating room performance of those residents. In a 2004 study by Sohumra et al using a maxillofacial simulator, cutting, separation, and quantitative rearrangement of bone during orthognathic surgery were simulated by means of a haptic device with virtual tactile perception. The study found the device useful for simulating various procedures for orthognathic surgery and for determining three-dimensional surgical movements. The question remains, however, if there are better methods than computer simulation to introduce training oral surgery residents to orthognathics. The current study looked at the potential utility of using cadavers in the training of orthognathic surgery. OMFS interns and residents at the University of Pennsylvania Health System were offered a 1-day clinical course in orthognathic surgery in the winter of 2012 at a local cadaver lab, in which all attendees took turns as the primary operator of various orthognathic surgeries, under direct supervision and instruction of chief resident and attending surgeons. A study protocol was developed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania IRB to investigate the perceived utility and attitudes of participants of the cadaver training session through an online survey questionnaire. The online questionnaire consisted of 3 demographic questions followed by a series of 10 statements about the use of cadavers in orthognathic surgery that were each rated on a 10 point scale on level of agreement. All participants were invited to fill out the online survey, after being presented an informed consent. The online survey accepted responses for up to one month after the cadaver lab. There were a total of 12 residents and interns that were invited to participate, all 12 accepted the informed consent and responded to the survey, ranging from 1st year resident and interns, to 6th year graduating seniors. The results were descriptively analyzed. The vast majority of responses seemed to support the use of cadavers in the training of orthognathic surgery. In general, the residents felt the cadaver lab was a realistic simulation of orthognathic clinical procedures (avg 8/10), and that the procedures improved their clinical understanding of the procedures (average 9/10). Those surveyed were very enthusiastic about future use of cadavers, with at least 75% Strongly Agreeing 10/10 that they would be interested in different opportunities to learn other procedures on the cadaver and also would recommend the training to all oral surgery residents. In conclusion, cadaver lab training of surgical clinical experience of orthognathic surgery is a promising and effective training medium for oral and maxillofacial surgery residents.","L70875356     2012-09-25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

H. and Gilbert, T. and Ristig, K. and Chu, Q. Y. D.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000323609400006,English,,,"Introduction: As a consequence of surgical resident duty hour restrictions, there is a need for faculty to utilize novel teaching methods to convey information in a more efficient manner. The current paradigm of surgical training, which has not changed significantly since the time of Halsted, assumes that all residents assimilate information in a similar fashion. However, recent data has shown that learners have preferences for the ways in which they receive and process information. The VARK model categorizes learners as visual (V), aural (A), read/write (R), and kinesthetic (K). The VARK learning style preferences of surgical residents have not been previously evaluated. In this study, the preferred learning styles of general surgery residents were determined, along with faculty and resident perception of resident learning styles. In addition, we hypothesized that American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam (ABSITE) scores are associated with preference for a read/write (R) learning style.     Methods: The Fleming VARK learning styles inventory was administered to all general surgery residents at a university hospital-based program. Responses on the inventory were scored to determine the preferred learning style for each resident. Faculty members were surveyed to determine their accuracy in identifying the preferred learning style of each resident. All residents were also surveyed to determine their accuracy in identifying their peers' VARK preferences. Resident ABSITE scores were examined for association with preferred learning styles.     Results: Twenty-nine residents completed the inventory. Most (18 of 29, 62%) had a multi-modal preference, although more than a third (11 of 29, 38%) demonstrated a single-modality preference. Seventy-six percent of all residents (22 of 29) had some degree of kinesthetic (K) learning, while under 50% (14 of 29) were aural (A) learners. Although not significant, dominant (R) learners had the highest mean ABSITE scores. Faculty identified residents' learning styles accurately 41% of the time; more experienced faculty were better than less experienced ones (R-2 - 0.703, P - 0.018). Residents had similar accuracy to faculty in identifying their peers' learning styles. Chief residents were more accurate than junior residents (44% versus 28%, P = 0.009).     Conclusions: Most general surgery residents have a multimodal learning preference. Faculty members are relatively inaccurate at identifying residents' preferred learning styles; however, there is a strong correlation between years of faculty experience and accuracy. Chief residents are more accurate than junior residents at learning style identification. Higher mean ABSITE scores may be a reflection of a dominant read/write learning style. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: During the past decade, we developed and integrated a 3-year cardiovascular limited ultrasound exam (CLUE) training program within the confines of an accredited internal medicine residency at a 300-bed community hospital program that accepts 10 residents/year. Since beginning with internship year (2002) and after entire residency immersion in CLUE (2005), we assessed CLUE competency using an objective test (CLUE-CEX) at graduation (2008-2011) and noted participation in extracurricular CLUE research. Program feedback was obtained using a Likert-style questionnaire (2011). Analysis of variance and linear regression assessed for relationships between gender, academic scores and performance to CLUE-CEX scores. Results: A brief, 5-minute CLUE was taught in monthly lectures with web-based, bedside and echo lab training methods and integrated within the cardiology consult, outpatient clinic and intensive-care residency rotations. Every resident participated in the curriculum, each accumulating at least 20 proctored studies. In attempting to achieve an unremanded CLUE competency score of >80% on the CLUE-CEX, 8/41 (19.5%) senior residents failed. The CLUE program did not exert a negative effect upon the academic performance of the residency, as evidenced by the lack of a significant difference in the Pre-CLUE and CLUE-CEX four-year periods in average resident In-training percentile rank scores (67.5 ±20.1 vs. 69.4 ±16.9, p=0.37). CLUE-CEX scores did not relate to male gender (p=0.07), academic scores (r=0.05, p=0.75) nor chief resident selection (r=0.15, p=0.37). During CLUE development, 4 residents applied to cardiology fellowship; 10 authored CLUE research studies. Questionnaires returned by 100% of the graduating residents in 2011 demonstrated positive statements attesting to the amount of time spent learning CLUE, its appropriateness, and anticipated use after residency. Conclusions: We report our initial experience in developing and sustaining a training program for bedside cardiovascular ultrasound examination that employed evidence-based techniques, set competency goals, and assessed resident performance with unbiased, consecutive and complete enrollment. It may be feasible to teach future internists the technique of bedside cardiac ultrasound during residency.","L70816799     2012-07-26 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"
"",Achieving Consistent Expectations and Empowering Senior Residents on Inpatient Family-Centered Rounds (QI Abstract),2017,1,1,Academic Pediatrics,1876-2859,17,5,e8-e9,"King, Erin E. and Dahlquist, Heather and Hickey, Patricia",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L617343741     http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2017.04.044,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Inpatient rounding constitutes a major component of resident learning. At our tertiary care hospital, we encourage Family Centered Rounds (FCR) which increase patient and family satisfaction and provide opportunity for feedback and modeling leadership. Through observation and evaluation data, we note considerable variation in rounding expectations and the extent to which the senior resident is empowered to lead FCR. Our baseline data were collected using a tool created at MCW (SREA-21). Using this, we found the senior resident entered first 19%, felt empowered to lead 56%, the senior and attending discussed as colleagues 69%, and the attending directed eye contact to the senior 56% of the time. After sharing these findings, the group agreed upon the following three goals: setting clear expectations, senior resident empowerment, and in-room rounding. AIM STATEMENT: There were two aims of our project. The first was to increase the % of rounding weeks where senior residents felt empowered as a leader from 56% to 75% within 6 months. The second was to encourage attending physicians to provide clear expectations to their team during 100% of their weeks on service. Balancing measures included evaluation of in versus out-of-room rounding and timing of FCR to aid future quality improvement. INTERVENTIONS: Our intervention was a presentation to the hospitalist group on effective clinical teaching. This included information about ACGME recommendations, the history of FCR, current practice as observed, self-assessment tools, and introduction to rounding like a ninja (focusing on senior resident empowerment). During the data collection period, we provided an interim report on metrics, re-emphasized education, and goals of the intervention. MEASURES:We collected data over 6 months, using an adapted version of SREA-21. Chief residents, the associate director, and/ or a trained observer collected data. Timing of each rounding encounter, rounding location (in- versus out-of room), diversion of primary eye contact to the senior resident, senior speaking first, the senior adding teaching points, and whether the senior resident and attending discussed the case as colleagues were recorded. Senior residents were surveyed weekly regarding subjective feelings of empowerment and whether clear expectations were set by the attending. All responses were recorded in a shared, password-protected spreadsheet. RESULTS: After the 6 months, the percent of rounding weeks senior residents felt empowered as a leader increased from 56% to 75%. Rounding expectations were provided to the learners 92-100% of the service weeks surveyed. We noted subjective and objective factors prolonging rounding encounters. Our group rounds longer than published average with FCR at an average of 14.47 minutes (range 2-43 min). Our group went ?30% faster when completing rounds inside the patient room. Results were shared with attending hospitalists in an online newsletter and a department meeting. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS: Senior resident empowerment and establishing expectations for FCR are possible with minimal effort. Rounding consistency is achievable within a diverse group of inpatient hospitalists at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital, however we may have noted a Hawthorne Effect. The most significant factor leading to increased leadership was allowing the senior resident to respond first to the intern or student presentation. During our study, we also switched from phone to pager-based communication which improved senior resident participation. Next steps in this project include providing tips on rounding efficiency, implementing FCT best practice guidelines, and creating a rounding coach program.

Residents in our program would routinely complete rotation evaluations for the inpatient pediatric service but would only seldom evaluate individual faculty hospitalists out of concern for anonymity. Hospitalists requested more individualized feedback. Aim Statement This project aimed to 1) Increase the percentage of completed evaluations of hospitalists above 80% 2) Improve the quality of hospitalist feedback as determined by resident and faculty satisfaction surveys in 4 months Interventions The hospitalist evaluation form was revised to address areas of importance to hospitalists and residents. Chief residents moderated meetings where members of the resident inpatient team completed group-based evaluations of individual hospitalists. Measures A 4-question survey was distributed to hospitalists and another 4-question survey distributed to residents, both based on a 5-point Likert scale. Surveys were completed before and 4 months after implementation of the changes. A run chart was made, and pre- and post-survey data of responses were compared using the Mann-Whitney and probability proportion tests. RESULTS: The percent of completed evaluations increased from 0% to 80% in one month and to 100% in the next 5 months. Hospitalist satisfaction increased above 80%, with statistically significant increases for all survey questions. Resident satisfaction with the evaluation process increased significantly. Positive trends that were not statistically significant included resident perception that evaluations are anonymous and that hospitalists use evaluations to improve. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS: Group-based resident evaluations of individual hospitalists led to an increased percentage of completed evaluations and increased satisfaction with evaluations among hospitalists. These changes, which will be sustained, led to increased resident satisfaction with the evaluation process. Limiting factors included incomplete resident participation in the new evaluation process due to scheduling. This evaluation system will be implemented on additional services.","L617344379     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

S.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000440259002267,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Promoting adult learners to continue their education independently is one of the most important objectives of graduate medical education (GME). A common example of this occurring in Internal Medicine residency programs nationwide is a chief resident-facilitated case conference, also known as Resident Report. However, little is known about whether the clinical cases or concepts discussed during report leave a lasting impact on the resident learners, particularly as the busy clinical context may detract from knowledge acquisition, retention, and optimization of the learning climate. The objective of our project was to use an online blog organized by chief residents to summarize the salient teaching points from report, reference key literature, and provide a way for residents to reinforce concepts independently. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This project took place within the Internal Medicine Residency Program at University of California at San Francisco (UCSF). Participants included chief residents at each of three UCSF-affiliated Hospitals, and the resident physician trainees enrolled in the UCSF IM Residency Program. DESCRIPTION: Following every Resident Report, the chief residents at each hospital submit a one page blog post detailing the learning points derived from each report session. Each entry starts with a de-identified one-liner for the patient case followed by pertinent clinical pearls from the discussion. The posts end with a link to a notation program (Evernote) to allow for resident and faculty subscribers to use the pearls in their own teaching materials in the future. The blog can be accessed easily from online search engines, and the platform generates daily emails to subscribers when a post is completed. EVALUATION: The chief resident blog has 711 posts to date with a total of 12,525 visitors, 40,114 views, and 51 subscribers. We plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the blog by organizing resident focus groups and circulating a residency-wide survey on the utilization and clinical relevance of the website. The goal will be to understand how the blog is used by learners and its impact on knowledge retention as well as other functions like future clinical teaching and patient care. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Little is known about best practice for using online blog posting for dissemination of teaching material from resident reports or case conferences in GME. We hope to demonstrate widespread use of the blog as an effective complement to resident report teaching and assess its impact on knowledge retention by residents, clinical teaching, and patient care.","Suppl. 2     Go7oj     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

We sought to create a formalized, targeted curriculum for incoming PGY-2 residents to ease the transition to radiation oncology. Purpose/Objective(s): The Kern's six-step model was used to develop, implement, and assess our pilot curriculum. After our problem identification (step 1), a targeted needs assessment (step 2) was performed through one-on-one interviews of ten current Stanford residents. The results of these interviews were used to formalize our goals and objectives (step 3) and develop our specific educational strategies (step 4). We then implemented our pilot curriculum (step 5) with the four incoming PGY-2 residents at Stanford in July 2016, with pre-and post-curriculum surveys administered for evaluation and feedback (step 6). Results: In our targeted needs assessment, all ten residents reported significant difficulty with the transition to radiation oncology. The top three reported reasons for this difficulty were: 1) lack of knowledge of radiation oncology ""fundamentals,"" such as terminology, sim set ups, kV/CBCTs, etc., 2) difficulty understanding workflow, such timing of documentation, contouring, etc., and 3) unclear service-specific expectations. Based on these results, we developed a 4-part pilot curriculum consisting of weekly two-hour chief-resident led didactic sessions. The topics covered in each session were: 1) Intro to Rad Onc & Clinic Overview, 2) Contouring & Plan Evaluation, 3) Sims, Daily XRT, & CBCT/kVs, and 4) Call Issues & RT Toxicities. Our pre-and post-curriculum surveys demonstrated that all participants found the curriculum either very (50%) or extremely (50%) useful. 3/4 residents felt unprepared prior to the curriculum, while only one resident still felt unprepared after. The mean anxiety (scale 1-10) decreased from 6.75 to 5.0 after the curriculum. On average, residents felt moderately or highly knowledgeable of only 9% of the ""fundamentals"" of radiation oncology prior to the curriculum, compared to 66% after. Finally, residents felt at least slightly comfortable with 0% of day-to-day tasks prior to the curriculum, compared to 62% after. Conclusion: We successfully designed and implemented a pilot curriculum to ease the transition to radiation oncology residency. After completion of the curriculum, incoming PGY2s felt more prepared and less anxious, and overall found it very or extremely useful. Through collaboration with the Radiation Oncology Education Collaborative Study Group, we look forward to expanding this curriculum to other institutions nation and worldwide.","Suppl.

Describe the design of a resident-led quality improvement program that included a financial incentive to increase rates of documentation of advance care planning discussions in the medical record. 2. Detail the effects of the intervention on rates of documentation of advance care planning discussions. 3. Identify key components that contributed to the program's success. Background. Advance care planning (ACP) discussions ensure that end of life care is in accord with patients' preferences. Inconsistent documentation of inpatient discussions puts patients at risk for unwanted interventions after discharge. Research Objectives. To design and implement a resident-led quality improvement program including a financial incentive to ensure that the results of inpatient ACP discussions are available across care transitions. Method. In response to frustration about inconsistent documentation of ACP discussions, two internal medicine residents, in coordination with program faculty, designed a multimodal quality improvement project to encourage residents to assess and document patients' wishes for end of life care. A field was incorporated into the electronic discharge summary template for residents to document details of ACP discussions occurring during admission. We set a goal for residents to document discussions in the template for 75% of discharged patients. The program included: 1) financial incentive of $400 dollars per resident if goal reached from July 1st, 2011 to May 31st, 2012; 2) providing real time biweekly email feedback about individual rates of completion; 3) monthly education at chief resident orientations and quality improvement conferences. Result. Rates of successful completion increased from 21% to around 90% over the course of the program. Key factors contributing to program success included the resident-led nature of the project, frequent audit and feedback, and the financial incentive. Assessment of sustainability is ongoing. Conclusion. A resident-led quality improvement program including a financial incentive resulted in significant increases in the documentation of ACP discussions in an easy location for outpatient and inpatient providers to locate across care transitions. Implications for Research, Policy, or Practice. Documenting ACP discussions in a single section of the electronic medical record is a straightforward way to ensure that patients' wishes are accessible across care transitions. Actively engaging and incentivizing physicians in efforts to improve documentation of ACP discussions is key to success.","L70988678     2013-02-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

While some barriers (high patient volume, low support staff ratios) may be unavoidable, others could be addressed by clinicianeducators to enhance the educational experience for resident providers. Using mixed method inquiry, we sought to identify areas needing improvement to meet resident educational goals. METHODS: We surveyed all second and third year internal medicine residents (primary care and categorical) whose continuity clinic was based at the San Francisco General Hospital General Medicine Clinic during the 2010-2011 academic year using the Veterans Health Administration Learners' Perceptions Survey-a 76-item instrument with established reliability and validity that measures satisfaction on a Likert-like scale (1 =poor, 5=excellent) in 6 domains: faculty interactions (14 items); the learning (16), working (12), clinical (14), and physical (6) environments; and personal/professional experience (14). We further explored the resident experience of items with a mean score <4 by conducting four resident focus groups (primary care and categorical) led by the ambulatory chief resident and captured responses by transcription. We used iterative thematic analysis to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: 16 of 32 (50%) residents participated in the survey. Of the 76 survey items, 35 averaged a score below 4: 14% of items in the faculty interactions domain, 56% in the learning environment, 50% in the working environment, 71% in the clinical environment, 50% in the physical environment and 36% in personal/professional experience. 15 of 32 (47%) residents participated in one of four focus groups. Exploration of the transcripts yielded 4 themes: 1. Need for longitudinal clinical mentorship (For my most complicated patients, I need a 'go to' [preceptor] sometimes, its really complicated and re-presenting [to a different attending every visit]just doesn't work); 2. Increased direct observation and feedback ([I would like] a much more structured set up where [the same preceptor] just walks in and watches us[monthly]); 3. More time for panel management (We are learning things on our own in a time constrained environment and the only time you can do it is when you are in clinicit is not realistic to do panel management while you are on an inpatient rotation); 4. Learning clinic efficiency and time management skills ([I] Feel like I never have enough time [to get through clinic] and when I graduate, I will have to see even more patients [per clinic session]). CONCLUSIONS: Residents identify multiple domains in which their safety-net continuity clinic experience can be educationally enhanced. Interventions that increase longitudinal clinical precepting, enhance direct observation and feedback, and teach panel management skills may improve resident satisfaction with continuity clinic experiences and increase retention in primary care careers.","Suppl. 2     V35ig     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

METHODS: Patients with PCa who underwent RALP prior to and after implementing a dual-console system at an academic tertiary care center were reviewed from 2006-2012. All surgeries were performed by a single faculty surgeon well after the learning curve was established. In all cases chief residents participated in the surgery and were allowed to perform progressively more portions of the procedure. Demographic, intraoperative and pathologic parameters were obtained. Continence and erectile function were assessed at 6 and 12 months. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Predictors of outcomes on univariate analysis were included in multivariate logistic or linear models as appropriate. RESULTS: Of 381 patients, 185 and 196 underwent single- or dual-console RALP respectively. There was a significant decrease in mean operative time using the dual console system (222 vs. 171 minutes, p < 0.0001) as well as in the incidence of intraoperative complications (8.65% vs. 1.53%, p < 0.0001) and postoperative complications (14.1% vs. 6.63%, p = 0.03.) Complications of Clavien grade ?3a occurred more frequently with a single-console system (7% vs. 1%, p = 0.003.) These differences persisted when controlling for potential confounders by multivariate regression. CONCLUSIONS: When training resident surgeons to perform RALP, a dual-console system may improve intraoperative and perioperative outcomes. The dual-console may represent a safer, more efficient modality and may be a more ideal platform for robotic surgical education as compared to a single console-system.","L71598973     2014-09-04 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

S. and Hofstetter, K.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000358386902053,English,,,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Identify the potential interaction between isoniazid and sulfonylureas that may lead to hyperglycemia in diabetic patients LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Identify potential roles of other disciplines, team work, and interprofessional clinical training for the mutual care of complex patients CASE: Mr. H is a 67 year old male veteran with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, depression, and recently diagnosed latent tuberculosis infection. Over the past year, his hemoglobin A1C had increased from 7.6 to 9.6 %. His primary care provider (a nurse practitioner fellow) added glipizide to metformin to control his hyperglycemia. The patient recorded fasting blood glucose levels of 100-170 on this regimen. The veteran then had a PPD placed which resulted in 10 mm of induration. He had no symptoms of active TB infection and a normal chest x ray. Isoniazid was initiated for treatment of latent TB infection. Six weeks into his therapy, he presented with hyperglycemia. He noted morning fasting blood glucose levels of 230-350 and was experiencing polyuria and polydipsia. During the clinic encounter, the NP fellow precepted with her NP supervisor and an MD chief resident. Together, they identified a potential drug-drug interaction between isoniazid and sulfonylureas. They consulted with the pharmacist and pharmacy trainee present in the same precepting room who recommended discontinuing glipizide. Within the primary care clinic, they were able to work with a pharmacist, pharmacy trainees, and the patient aligned care team (PACT) nurse to start the veteran on insulin glargine. The veteran was able to continue isoniazid therapy and now has a hemoglobin A1C of 6.1 %. DISCUSSION: Isoniazid (INH) is known to cause metabolic derangements and hepatotoxicity. It is thought to cause hyperglycemia (even in non-diabetic patients) by stimulating the release of glucagon and inhibiting the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. This directly antagonizes the action of sulfonylureas, which exert their primary hypoglycemic action by stimulating pancreatic insulin release. Isoniazid therapy for latent TB infection is recommended for 9 months. Therefore, patients beginning this therapy, especially those with diabetes, should be monitored for hyperglycemia. Often, oral hypoglycemic medications need to be stopped and insulin therapy initiated to maintain glycemic control. This complicated scenario was managed with multiple disciplines within the West Haven VA Primary Care Center of Excellence (CoE) in Primary Care Education. The CoE is a unique training environment for internal medicine residents as they learn alongside trainees from other disciplines (including nurse practitioner fellows, pharmacy residents, and health psychology fellows). Residents are supervised by and precept with nurse practitioner faculty. Likewise, nurse practitioner trainees work with MD faculty. Within this training environment, pharmacists and pharmacy trainees are available directly in the precepting space to listen to trainee presentations and offer guidance. Patients are able to experience a warm hand off wherein the NP or MD trainee seeing the patient in primary care clinic can introduce the patient to another team member (such as a pharmacy or mental health trainee) to assist in management without the patient even needing to leave the room. The CoE also places importance on sustained longitudinal relationships (for patients and between disciplines) to ensure that patients are followed long term by the entire team. Nurses and health technicians are also an equal voice in team structure and changes and actively follow patients on their team. With this model of teamwork and interdisciplinary care, this veteran was able to complete treatment for latent TB infection while attaining superior glycemic control.","Suppl. 2     Cn4fv     2198845     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

They typically receive minimal formal education in geriatrics, teaching skills and leadership. With support from the John A. Hartford Foundation and ADGAP, BUMC disseminated its successful 2-day offsite CRIT program, addressing these deficiencies, to demonstrate national replicability. Methods: Through a competitive RFP, 12 institutions in 3 cohorts were selected to implement CRIT across specialties for 2 years each. The modular curriculum included an unfolding case discussed in small groups, evidence-based mini-lectures on geriatrics topics, and interactive seminars on teaching and leadership skills. 1-to-1 consults helped CRs develop an action project. Social opportunities were provided to develop relationships. Faculty mentors were invited to increase institutional buy-in. BUMC's support to each institution included attending BUMC's CRIT. National evaluation of CRIT included a self-report pre-survey, a 12-item pre- and immediate post- CRIT knowledge test, and a 6-month follow-up survey, administered by each institution. Results across institutions and cohorts were merged for analysis. Results: Over 3 years in 12 institutions, 301 CRs and 86 faculty mentors participated in CRIT, representing 29 specialties. Response rates for CRs were 99% (n=299) for the pre-survey, 97% (n=293) for the pre-post test, and 78% (n=234) for matching pre to 6-month followup. CRs showed significant gains in knowledge (p<.001). Reported frequency of teaching geriatrics increased pre to 6-months (p<.001) as did confidence in ability to apply clinical problem solving skills to the care of older patients, responsibility CRs feel for teaching others about geriatrics issues, and extent to which others view the CR as a resource in geriatrics (all p<.001). Average number of topics covered in teaching related to the care of older patients doubled from 4.3 to 8.5 (p<.001). Finally, CRs showed significant improvements in confidence related to four leadership skills and overall leadership required to carry out work as CRs (p<.001). Most credited these changes at least somewhat to CRIT. Conclusion: A 2-day retreat for CRs improved geriatrics knowledge, increased teaching of geriatrics topics, and enhanced skills needed to be a CR, and can be replicated successfully across institutions.","Suppl. 4 Sp.

Our objective was to determine the efficacy of a simulation-based ACLS curriculum to improve the preparation of house staff to lead teams while managing cardiac arrest. METHODS: This quality improvement project occurred at a VA affiliated with an academic internal medicine residency program. The participants were internal medicine house staff who rotated at the VA during the intervention period (March-December 2014). We performed a longitudinal pre/post analysis to assess the ACLS knowledge, confidence, and leadership skills of residents who have completed a simulation-based ACLS curriculum. The intervention consisted of a didactic lecture focused on ACLS knowledge and practical aspects of running a code (such as how to use the defibrillator). We also conducted an hour-long simulation exercise that included two simulated code scenarios. These simulation exercised were conducted in small groups of house staff (4-5 at a time). The chief resident also led a debriefing after each simulation. We evaluated the effectiveness of the curriculumin a few different ways. First, we distributed a quiz to all house staff in the program that assessed their initial experience, knowledge, and confidence related to code situations. Second, during each of the two simulations, the performance of the house staff as a team was graded by a chief resident, based on a rubric of pre-determined ACLS and Crisis Resource Management (CRM) tasks. Third, the house staff assessed their confidence before and after participating in the simulation (this assessment was added later). Lastly, a post-simulation questionnaire was completed by all participating residents assessing the value of the simulation training. RESULTS: To date, 51 house staff have participated in the simulation exercise. House staff who had not participated in any simulation based training rated their comfort leading a code an average of 2.44/5, with 5 being most comfortable (STD=.95, N=77). In a pre/ post simulation comparison, house staff who completed the training showed a higher level of confidence leading codes after completing the simulation session (3.33/5 vs. 4.00/5; P= 0.15, N=16). House staff who completed simulation based ACLS training also showed a significantly higher confidence in their knowledge of ACLS algorithms (4.33/5 vs. 3.96/5; P=.034). Improvement in resident ACLS and CRM performance, as graded by a chief resident, improved from the first to second simulations (7.5/18 vs. 11.4/18; P=.084). In the post simulation survey, 100 % of house staff agreed or strongly agreed that their leadership skills and level of ACLS knowledge improved by completing the training (N= 51). Lastly, 100% of residents who completed the training agreed it was worth taking time out of their work day to complete (N=51). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a simulation based ACLS intervention may increase house staff confidence, knowledge, and leadership when leading a code team. This may improve outcomes as well as team dynamics in code situations. Further investigation into the translation of simulation training into the actual patient care setting should be investigated.","Suppl. 2     Cn4fv     2200254     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

There are challenges in implementing a meaningful Systems-Based Practice experience in a large medical residency program. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: To have residents participate in a programwide, long-term Systems-Based Practice experience using a Quality Improvement (QI) initiative. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: To provide residents with quarterly Diabetes Performance Reports using Clinical Looking Glass, a hospital developed software program. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 3: To troubleshoot the creation and distribution of the data feedback performance reports by requiring regular communication with the department of information technology. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION: Our Systems-Based Practice curriculum included lectures on QI concepts and resident reviews of their Influenza vaccination rates during their ambulatory medicine rotations. Beginning September 2009, all residents participated in a long-term, QI initiative to improve diabetic outcome processes in our teaching clinics. Diabetes Performance Report templates were created by our Information Technology (IT) department using the hospital developed software, Clinical Looking Glass. Each report was generated by the medical directors of each clinic site and distributed by the ambulatory chief resident. Each report listed the resident's diabetic patient panel with outcome processes such as A1c or LDL measurements. In addition to receiving a diabetes performance report, half of the residents were randomized to receive a worksheet that outlines specific clinical management steps to improve these performance indicators. These steps included selecting five patients with the highest A1c levels, reviewing all diabetes outcomes like LDL measurements, calling patients every two weeks until diabetic goals were met and documenting all patient interventions. All reports and worksheets were distributed every quarter by e-mail. Residents were encouraged to discuss their findings with their clinic attending supervisors to improve learning and encourage teamwork. FINDINGS TO DATE: All residents received individualized data feedback performance for the first quarter of the academic year. It took 4 weeks to generate and distribute each resident specific diabetes performance report. Foreseeing potential technical and logistical difficulties, regular meetings during the first quarter were scheduled with the IT department to discuss obstacles encountered and concerns related to the reports. This resulted in a reduction in performance report generation and distribution time from 4 weeks to 1 hour. The QI initiative was initially well received but with some hesitancy. Verbal and e-mail feedback included concerns about patient attribution, fear of being blamed for their patient's outcomes, and doubts about the utility of completing a worksheet. The overall worksheet compliance was 67% (33/50). KEY LESSONS LEARNED: We successfully launched a program-wide, long-term QI initiative using resident specific data feedback performance reports and detailed worksheets to improve patients' diabetic outcome processes in our teaching clinics. This required a multidisciplinary effort with medical directors, clinic attendings, chief resident and IT. The challenges of creating, generating, distributing and collecting the reports and worksheets were overcome by scheduling regular operational meetings with all parties involved. Future plans will include direct communication between medical directors and residents to improve compliance. Our QI initiative fulfilled the System-Based Practice ACGME core competency with a practical experience.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Gen Intern Med. 2010 Jun;25 Suppl 3:S205-567. doi: 10.1007/s11606-010-1338-5.

OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to demonstrate that the creation of a modern multimedia website for program-related resources may also serve as an effective method of dual-communication between the program and residents. METHODS: A new website, published June 2016, provided a responsive user experience that facilitated quick online and mobile access to rotation guides, educational resources, program policies, and resident surveys. Additionally, program announcements were made via blog posts on the website over the following 6 months, totaling 113 individual posts. Links to new posts and updates were advertised in the chief resident weekly email. Analysis of utilization via page views (PV) was completed via Google Analytics. RESULTS: For the first six months of the 2016-2017 academic year, a total of 20,787 PV was recorded, an average of 216 PV/ resident. The 3 categories with the highest PV included rotation guides (38.9%), blog posts (22.6%), and clinical resources (16.5%). 5 of the top 10 most viewed blog posts consisted of monthly state-of-the-program updates from the program director. Analysis of the variance in PV of programmatic updates and clinical, logistical and educational resources point to resident interest and engagement in program development, as well as the need for improvement in various curricular and resource areas. CONCLUSION: A residency program specific website can be created and used not just as a storehouse of program and clinical resources, but also as an effective means of communicating program news and updates to residents who are accustomed to consuming news and media via the internet. Analysis of website utilization and user behavior can also provide insight into resident interests and curricular needs providing real-time feedback loops that can be utilized for program improvement.","L617343954     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

In the evolving field of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) and the emerging medical atmosphere of value- and evidence-based medicine, the training of competent physiatrists who can rise to become future leaders is an important endeavor in facilitating growth. The purpose of this study was to examine how one residency training program's (RTP) structure of multiple leadership roles influenced the development of its alumni as future leaders and physiatrists. Design: The RTP mentioned above compartmentalizes administrative and educational tasks into independent leadership roles on a global and local scale. These are then assigned to residents based on interest, merit, and seniority. Such a system allows more residents to experience leadership and gain the skills from leading. It also redistributes work across the entire residency class so that individual leaders can be more productive and effective. An internet-based survey was distributed to the alumni of this program from the inception of this model. Setting: Residency Training Program Participants: Alumni of a PMR RTP Results or Clinical Course: A total of 50 alumni responded to the questionnaire. Of those, 86% had been in a leadership role during residency training and 44% were in a leadership role at the time of survey completion. Of those who did participate as a chief resident or in a leadership track, 74% felt it was either very helpful or helpful in adding value to their training as physiatrists. Finally, 72% felt that having residents fill leadership roles enabled the program to accomplish more of its goals. Conclusions: The development of leaders in the field of PMR is crucial to its growth, longevity, and success in the current medical system. The strategy of one RTP was to create multiple leadership roles which led to alumni taking on future leadership positions, feeling that they had extra value in their training as physiatrists, and feeling that it enabled the program to achieve more of its goals. Further research is needed to study the effect of this construct on leadership development.","L71206175     2013-11-01 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Ultrasound (US) has recently been introduced into trauma centers in the United States as a quick, cheap, and safe method to make the diagnosis of BAT. After theoretical and practical training, one attending surgeon and one chief resident began performing trauma ultrasounds at a rural, Level 1 trauma center. The US was performed concurrent with initial resuscitation and prior to other studies. The US was then correlated with the other tests. Of the 82 tests performed, 79 correlated with other methods of diagnosis. Overall, US was 88 per cent sensitive, 98 per cent specific, and 96 per cent accurate in diagnosing intra-abdominal injuries.

Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Chief residents often function as a mediator between the resident body and the department administration. Additionally, chief residents are responsible for the resident call and rotation schedule as well as resident vacation. These responsibilities and the appropriate actions one must take are often learned on the job and from mistakes learned along the way during the year.

M. and Tatchin, D. and Price, R. and Wiggins, J.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000209846500164,English,,,"Introduction: With the specialized care that geriatric psychiatrists provide, psychiatric billing codes do not capture the depth and breadth of our services. In a teaching institution, this effect on billing is magnified by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) billing guidelines. The guidelines for psychiatric billing codes require that attending physicians be present for the entire therapy session i.e. half or full with evaluation and management (E&M), which is not practical. Family therapy with the patient present is an option for key portions presence by an attending physician, but has rigid guidelines. Additionally, psychotherapy codes are not appropriate for most dementia patients. The medication review code allows the attending to be present for key portions of a session, but does not accurately describe many geriatric psychiatry encounters, and has low reimbursement. In training settings, residents are often detached from the billing process, and do not have a vested interest in optimizing coding. Often, the same note template is used for all outpatient services without regard to billing needs. To improve the accuracy of coding and reimbursement for complex geriatric psychiatry services, while enhancing the trainee's awareness of billing, the section of geriatric psychiatry implemented a medical E&M billing system. We sought to explore: 1) The difference in reimbursement, comparing psychiatric billing codes to medical E&M codes 2) Challenges in documentation to support the level of billing 3) The resident physician billing behaviors, assessing for change from the beginning to end of the geriatric psychiatry rotation Methods: At the University of Michigan Outpatient Geriatric Psychiatry Clinic, located in the multidisciplinary Geriatrics Center, training clinics occur 5 half days per week, and include PGY 3 residents in a 6 month block (5-6) , PGY 5 geriatric psychiatry fellows in year-long rotation (2), and a Geriatric Medicine Fellow (1 per month) . Of these training clinics, all new patients (NPs) are staffed and 4/5 clinics have protected clinical staffing for all return visits (RVs). Six faculty members have weekly private clinics without trainees present. To implement medical E&M billing, three vital signs need documented at each visit. For the trainee's return visits, a full 14 point review of systems, past medical history, past psychiatric history, family history, and social history must be reviewed to qualify for higher coding levels. For the attending physicians' private patients, a time-based medical E&M billing can occur if greater than 50% of the visit was spent in counseling and coordinating care. Additionally, a five point review of systems needs to be reviewed or referenced. After determining the documentation changes which would need to occur, we negotiated vitals be done by Medical Assistants (MAs) on all geropsychiatry patients seen in our clinics. New documentation templates were drafted, and distributed to both faculty and residents. Changes were discussed extensively with teaching faculty in section meetings. For residents, e-mail and a brief chief -resident announcement occurred during resident orientation, and was reinforced by the clinic attending physician at the beginning of the trainees' geriatric psychiatry rotation. Results: With the assistance of the psychiatry billing department, we will review and compare geriatric psychiatry clinic billing, documentation, and reimbursement data using psychiatry codes compared to medical E&M codes. We will separate data for trainee's clinics and attending clinics, due to different documentation requirements. Common coding errors, documentation lapses, and missed reimbursement will be explored. Billing and documentation trends over the course of the rotation for trainees will be reported. Conclusions: Medical E&M billing provides a way to capture the unique aspects of collateral information gathering, and the medical and neurologic assessments which occur in geriatric psychiatry. At the University of Michi an, the implementation in a training clinic has been realized due to the physical location in a multidisciplinary geriatrics center where MA's were already utilized, a clinical staffing model in which 4/5 resident clinics have protected staffing for all RVs, and the support of the Department of Psychiatry and our host- the Geriatrics Center. Additionally, residents gain awareness of a key real-world issue that is neglected in many training programs.","Suppl. 1     V45wk     Nr 39     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"
WOS:000340996201218,Walking the Talk to Improve Error Reporting,2014,1,1,Journal of General Internal Medicine,,29,,S249-S249,"Mandapakala, C. and Levine, D. L.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000340996201218,English,,,"BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine's landmark report, To err is human; building a safer health system highlighted the importance of discussing medical errors in healthcare. Since then, quality and safety organizations have recommended incident reporting. Learning from adverse events or even latent errors is crucial for quality improvement and patient safety. Yet under reporting remains a continuing problem, especially among physicians. The Internal Medicine (IM) residency program at Detroit Medical Center has over 100 residents who rotate at multiple clinical sites including a Veterans Medical Center (VAMC). Residents rotate at the VAMC for 0-3 months per year. Intermittent rotation and lack of continuity makes it challenging to implement patient safety initiatives, such as improving the incident reporting among residents. In addition, residents have to learn to use a different kind of electronic reporting system at each of their clinical sites. Baseline reporting information provided by the VAMC Patient Safety officer (PSO) showed that between July 2012 and June 2013 residents reported only 2 incident reports. The objective of this quality improvement initiative was to improve error reporting at VAMC by IM residents by understanding the barriers to reporting and implementing changes using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to achieve change. METHODS: Residents completed a pre-intervention questionnaire on the first day of their IM rotation at VAMC to see if they were aware of, and knew how to use, the Electronic Patient Incident Reporting (EPIR) system. Root cause analysis (RCA) was performed and multiple barriers to incident reporting were identified. Based on the information obtained, interventions were developed and implemented by the Chief Resident for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (CRQS) in PDSA cycles. Information on the number of incidents reported by medicine residents was provided monthly by the PSO. Interventions implemented through PDSA cycles have been summarized in Table 1. RESULTS: The number of incidents reported over time have also been shown in Table 1. Incidents reported were plotted over time in an XmR control chart (with upper and lower control limits at 3?) to understand the impact made by our interventions. On review of the baseline data from July 2012 to July 2013, if things were allowed to continue as they were, there was a 99 % probability that the number of incidents reported would be 0-1 per month. Current data over 5 PDSA cycles (32 incidents from August 2013 to December 2013) suggests that if our efforts continue to show similar results, there is a 99 % probability that the number of incidents reported would be 0-19 per month. CONCLUSIONS: RCA and PDSA cycles allowed us to identify and overcome barriers that prevented resident error reporting. Education (talking) alone was insufficient to increase error reporting. Walk rounds (walking) in conjunction with reinforcing education (talking) allowed us to increase error reporting. Discussion of potential events for reporting at the point-of-care increased error reporting. Walk rounds are effective but time intensive (1-1.5 h per day). To further develop the culture of safety the next PDSA cycles will focus on identifying resident champions from each year of training who will encourage and help their peers identify and report incidents (peer-to-peer coaching) to allow for sustainability and transportability to other clinical sites in our training program.

ECG interpretation skills are generally taught during the 3rd year Internal Medicine clerkship. At our institution, this was done in a nonstandardized lecture-based format without assessment of learner's knowledge, skills, or confidence. This educational innovation aimed to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to systematically analyze, interpret, and communicate key findings of ECGs among 3rd year medical students by delivering a curriculum covering all ECG diagnoses in the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM) learning objectives. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The course was delivered to third year medical students on the 8-week Hospitalized Adult Care (HAC) Clerkship. DESCRIPTION: Six flipped-classroom sessions were delivered across the 8- week HAC Clerkship in 3 consecutive blocks. Before each session, learners reviewedmaterials covering a topic in ECGinterpretation. During the sessions, theyworked in small groups applying skills they learned to the interpretation of 5 tracings, reporting their findings to the larger group. A Chief Resident provided feedback and facilitated discussion of key findings. Learners completed a pre- and post-assessment using a previously validated tool, and reported confidence in several tasks. EVALUATION: 62 students have completed the curriculum. There was statistically significant improvement on on each of the 17 questions of the knowledge assessment (p-value ranging from 0.02 to <0.0001). Mean performance improved from 45% to 88% (p < 0.0001) with mean increase of 5.8 correct answers. Over 90% of learners correctly identified Atrial Fibrillation, Right Bundle Branch Block, 1st Degree Atrio-ventricular Block, Atrial Flutter, Hyperkalemia and Premature Ventricular Complexes, with 98% correctly identifying ST-elevation Myocardial infarction on the post-test. Students responded to 9 questions assessing confidence in various components in ECG interpretation on a 4-point Likert scale (potential for maximum of 36 cumulative points). Pre-scores ranged from 3-30, and post scores ranged from 18-35 with mean improvement in overall score of 10.9 points (p < 0.0001) DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Implementation of an ECG curriculum in HAC clerkship resulted in statistically significant improvement in identification of important findings and confidence in ECG interpretation among 3rd year medical students. Verbal feedback from the students was positive, but students requested revision of the dense and lengthy preparatory materials, and more in-depth annotated discussion of each tracing covered in the sessions, which have now been revised. Evaluation of student performance with the updated format is ongoing.","Suppl. 2     Go7oj     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

C. and Saxe, J. and Dulay, M. H.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000358386902143,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Educating healthcare trainees in patient safety is imperative for promoting the Culture of Safety and expanding a workforce primed and able to redesign the healthcare system to reduce medical errors. Root cause analysis (RCA) is a patient safety tool used to elucidate the individual and system factors that contributed to an error or near miss. Our goal is to teach patient safety skills in an interprofessional outpatient setting through a curriculum that facilitates each trainee participating in an RCA exercise. Our learning objectives include ability to: identify safety problems in ambulatory settings, distinguish between individual and systems factors, and focus error prevention towards improving processes and systems. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVA) is one of five VA Centers of Excellence in Primary Care Education (COEPCE), an interprofessional, team-based training program of which patient safety and quality improvement are core components. Since 2011, 56 internal medicine residents and 15 adult gerontology nurse practitioner students with continuity clinic in SFVA primary care clinics have participated. Our primary care clinics are organized in the VA medical home model called Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT). Physician and NP faculty and quality and safety chief residents facilitate the RCA sessions. DESCRIPTION: RCA facilitators email trainees an overview of the RCA activity including a worksheet to complete which guides them through the RCA process. Trainees are paired together (members of the same PACT team when possible) and asked to choose a case of a medical error from their own primary care clinic experience that led to an adverse event or near miss. With at least 2 weeks lead-in time, the pair, with support from RCA facilitators, reviews the chart for the chosen case and interviews involved healthcare personnel. Each trainee pair presents the timeline of the case and leads an interactive discussion analyzing the factors that contributed to the error(s) and potential solutions in a 1-hour session. Two to three pairs present per session. Faculty ensure learning objectives are met during the discussion and communicate some of the proposed solutions generated by the conference to related services. EVALUATION: Post-session surveys revealed high marks from the trainees for this curricular activity (n=125). On a 1-5 scale (1=poor, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=very good, 5= excellent), trainees rated the overall quality of session as 4.6 (SD 0.64) and estimated likelihood of making changes in practice as a result of the session as 4.4 (SD 0.80). We performed a qualitative analysis of 33 RCA's from the past 3 years and identified 6 common contributing factors to the adverse events or near misses: poor communication between PACT members; poor communication between primary care providers (PCPs) and providers outside of PACT; poor provider-patient communication; missed follow-up appointments; lack of timely access to appointments or tests; and tests not followed up appropriately. Twenty-two RCA's had 2 factors identified, 7 had 3 factors identified, and 2 had 4 factors identified. The most prevalent contributing factors were poor communication between PCPs and providers outside the PACT (70 %) and poor provider-patient communication (58 %). DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: We developed a novel approach to patient safety education for interprofessional trainees in the outpatient setting that was highly rated and requires limited curricular time. Experiential learning is an ideal medium to teach quality improvement and patient safety skills: concepts that come from a brief trainee presentation can lead to tangible systems improvements. Communication errors contributed significantly in the RCA cases we reviewed, further emphasizing for our trainees the importance of the communication and teamwork training which is also part of our COEPCE program. Our next steps will be to improve opportunities for systems-based practice learning and optimization of clini al learning environments by involving the medical center's patient safety leadership in the RCA sessions. We will also ask presenters to revise and submit their proposed solutions from the RCA activity to leadership after incorporating input from the conference attendees. We strive for this curriculum to be both educational and contribute to system improvement; trainees' lasting impressions of this activity will arise from their work contributing to real change.","Suppl. 2     Cn4fv     2195315     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

This study aims to examine this relationship more closely in a mentorship model residency program. METHODS: All planned surgical procedures between January 2008 and September 2009 for two established urologic surgeons were examined. A total of 1476 cases were identified and classified by type of procedure, presence of resident involvement, educational level of resident, and total operative time. The surgeons' schedules were queried to detect changes in scheduled daily case volumes due to expectations of resident involvement. Common procedures of varying complexities (i.e. robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), laparoscopic nephrectomy, and cystoscopy, biopsy, and fulguration (CBF)) were selected to compare operative times with and without resident involvement and further subdivided by resident level. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's T test and one way ANOVA. RESULTS: No difference was seen in number of cases per day scheduled based on expectation of resident involvement for either surgeon. Resident involvement in CBF cases did not show any significant operative time differences at any level (staff only= 21 min vs any resident= 25 min, p=0.26). Laparoscopic nephrectomy times did reveal statistically significant differences between residency years. There was improvement with resident advancement, but times were still slightly longer than staff(p = 0.04). In regards to RARP, any resident involvement added a mean of 34 minutes per case with chief resident cases taking the longest likely due to increased participation (staff only= 154 min vs chief resident= 198 min, p<0.001). This represents an average of ? $740 increase in operative room cost. These data seem to reflect an expected increase in resident participation with time and subsequently longer operative times in more complex procedures. Less complex procedures reveal comparable surgical times even with increased participation proving effective skill learning. CONCLUSIONS: Resident participation increases operative times as resident independence increases especially in complex cases. However, overall case loads for attending surgeons can be maintained in a mentorship model residency program with appropriate progression of resident independence. Alternative training resources should be focused on more complex procedures to maximize productivity gains.","L70144026     2010-05-25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

L. and Cantor, A. and Busby, J. E.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000302912502361,English,,,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is now utilized in over 90% of radical prostatectomies in the US. Thus, more residency programs are emphasizing robotics. We sought to examine the current state of robotic training of American urology residents. METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent to all US urology residents who were urology year (URO) 1-4 in April and May of 2011. Residents were queried regarding their robotic training, experience, and details of the resources at their respective institutions. We broke down the RALP into 7 discrete steps and looked at factors that increased subjective confidence. RESULTS: 176 residents completed surveys with 100% of respondents having at least one daVinci surgical system at their institution. The majority of chief residents (55%) participated in greater then 50 RALP cases during residency. This is compared to 40% of pre chiefs (URO 3) and 7% of juniors (URO 1-2). Chief residents indicated significantly improved confidence with all steps of the RALP compared to both pre chiefs and juniors. Factors that were associated with increased confidence in chief residents on univariate analysis included number of staff performing robotics (?5), number of robots at the facility (>2), higher case volume at the program (>100 cases/year), higher number of previous RALP procedures (>50) and higher percentage of recent console time (various percentages for each step). On multivariate analysis the only factors that portended improved confidence were number of robots in the facility, higher number of previous RALP procedures, and higher percentage of recent console time. There was no significant difference in confidence in chiefs who had dual console trainers and in those who had formal robotic training programs. When asked if they plan on offering robotic procedures after residency 88% said yes, 4% said no, and 8% were unsure. A previous survey from 2005 indicated that 34% of residents would offer robotic procedures after graduation, 30% would not offer them and 33% were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant shift in the training of urology residents in robotic-assisted surgery in the last 6 years. Chief residents in urology appear to have a strong robotic experience with most graduating with at least 50 cases completed. Programs that have more robots, provide greater volume and more console time produce residents with higher confidence. Surprisingly, having a training console or formal training program did not improve subjective metrics. Most graduating residents in the US now plan on offering robotic procedures in their own practices.","Suppl.

The goal of this educational initiative is to identify Pathology residents' knowledge gaps using board review questions and improve knowledge retention related to these content areas. Secondary aims include program and implementation evaluations using the RE-AIM Framework Model developed by Glasgow et al. to evaluate the impact of the initiative based on the following criteria: Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. Design: Chief resident led bi-monthly board reviews sessions were composed using interactive, free teaching software (Socrative). Questions were open to all resident learners (Reach) and were based on ASCP PRISE questions (institutional subscription purchased). In a large group format learners were exposed to the questions and images, questions were answered individually using the software, and group knowledge was assessed by aggregate responses. A tailored lecture followed each question specifically targeting the knowledge gap to re-enforce critical concepts. Evaluation of this intervention is multifaceted. Outcomes are evaluated on a recurring basis and include: knowledge retention, resident satisfaction and learner exposure to the sessions. Each RE-AIM criteria is scored on a 0-1 scale. Conclusions: Interactive teaching can more effectively identify knowledge gaps than traditional passive-based lectures. Combining the use of of interactive software with a more tailored lecture improves resident learning and knowledge retention. The systematic approach of the RE-AIM Framework Model for implementation evaluation effectively identifies areas for improvement. The measurement of additional objective data such as the comparison of Board/RISE scores is currently ongoing.

OBJECTIVE: To create a racial justice workshop as a part of the core advocacy curriculum in the PGY-1 year of a large pediatric residency program. DESIGN/METHODS: Using Kern's model of curricular development, a local needs assessment was conducted. Goals and objectives were developed based on literature review and partnership with a community-based organization. A 3-hour workshop was created and led by a chief resident with intern groups of 10-12. Using the Burgess model of reducing racial biases in healthcare, the workshop includes didactics on the history of racism in medicine coupled with several small group exercises leveraging discussion and reflection. A survey was collected at the end of each workshop. RESULTS: 20 interns have participated in the workshop and survey so far, with data collection ongoing. Participants rate the workshop highly in terms of overall educational value and engagement (mean 4.85 on a Likert scale with 5 as the highest). 100% of interns felt this workshop was appropriate for the advocacy curriculum, that it should be repeated for future classes, and that it would impact their practice going forward. 16/20 respondents gave more information on practice change and of those, 15 stated they would be more open in engaging in conversations about race and racism with their patients. CONCLUSIONS: We created a racial justice workshop for interns as a part of our core advocacy curriculum. The workshop was highly rated and all respondents felt their practice would change as a result of the workshop.","L617343966     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Efforts to improve diversity often focus on recruitment without similar attention paid to educational prioritization and community-building, both of which critically inform a climate of inclusion. OBJECTIVE: To create a sustainable and effective residencywide structure to promote diversity and inclusion within a large pediatric residency program. DESIGN/METHODS: In 2016, the DERM program was formed, supported by a resident diversity council and overseen by a steering committee composed of a Diversity Chief Resident, faculty leaders, and resident leaders. Our definition of diversity includes but is not limited to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, and disability. Representatives of these groups and their allies, make up the council. The diversity council is divided into three working groups: recruitment, education, and maintenance. RESULTS: In our residency interview invitations, applicants are able to self-identify as diverse using the above definition with all who self-identify invited to attend a diversity dinner. As a result, the program has doubled the number of recruitment diversity dinners and improved applicant and program engagement with dinners. The education group has mapped our existing curricula in regards to implicit bias, cultural humility and racial justice training in order to identify gaps. The maintenance group has mapped pipeline programs, medical student diversity groups, and institutional diversity initiatives in order to form partnerships and mentoring relationships. A summary of the DERM program initiatives was presented to hospital and residency program leadership to align prioritization of diversity and inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Through the DERM initiative we created a sustainable structure to promote diversity and inclusion in our residency. Next steps include measuring the effectiveness of these interventions through post match data analysis and residencywide climate surveys.","L617343933     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Methods:     Four fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons and four orthopaedic chief residents each inserted 10 cancellous bone screws into a polyurethane foam cancellous bone substitute. Five screws were inserted with a standard orthopaedic screw driver, and five screws were inserted with a battery-powered electric driver. Samples were loaded to failure, and pullout strength was measured using a electromechanical tensile tester. Analysis of variance was used to compare experimental groups.     Results:     No significant difference was found between the pullout strengths of screws inserted by hand and the pullout strengths of screws inserted with an electric driver. Screws inserted by experienced orthopaedic surgeons, however, demonstrated significantly higher pullout strengths than screws inserted by orthopaedic trainees.     Conclusions:     Hand-driven and electrically-driven screws demonstrate similar pullout strengths in a model for orthopaedic screw insertion into bone. Screws inserted by experienced surgeons, however, did exhibit increased pullout strength. This suggests a technical nuance that allows experienced surgeons to better insert screws. If identified, this nuance would be of interest to orthopaedists in general.","Er8ne     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:14 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Research indicates that the quality and receptivity of feedback is enhanced when the message from the feedback giver aligns with trainees' personal learning goals. However, an intervention specifically designed to improve an trainee's feedback experience by aligning feedback with learning goals has not been described at our institution. OBJECTIVE: We sought to improve feedback via a pilot intervention that promotes goal-oriented feedback in pediatric residency. METHODS: During the 24-week study period (July-Dec 2016), interns on 5 general pediatrics inpatient floors were asked to submit personal learning goals for the week. Goals were submitted to the chief resident who then distributed them via email to the attending physician and senior residents. Attendings and seniors were encouraged to provide feedback on those goals. Process and outcome evaluation of the intervention were undertaken via interviews with 5 interns, 3 seniors, and 6 attendings. Interviews were transcribed and reviewed for commonly occurring concepts. RESULTS: Of 640 requests for goals made to interns during the study period, there were 240 responses (40.1%). Process evaluation information collected in the first half of the study period indicated that writing relevant learning goals required familiarity with the inpatient floor. Timing of goal collection and distribution was altered to improve intervention uptake. Data relevant to outcome evaluation suggested the intervention enabled seniors and attendings to be intentional in providing specific, targeted feedback that aligned with interns expressed learning goals, but did not increase the frequency of feedback. Despite theoretical utility, practical utility was hindered by time constraints and limited buy-in among interns, attendings, and seniors. CONCLUSION: Aligning feedback with personal learning goals may improve the quality and receptivity of feedback. However interventions to promote goal-oriented feedback need to consider over-riding barriers of time and buy-in.","L617344448     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Residentgenerated curriculum has been rarely published. After professional misconduct by a faculty member and reports of unprofessional conduct by residents from internal surveys of medical students, we surveyed our internal medicine residents to ask about gaps in professionalism training and optimal venues for professionalism education. Purpose: To develop case-based discussions within the morning report structure for resident-led discussion on professionalism topics which were not addressed by our standard faculty-generated curriculum. Description: A 9- item survey was distributed to residents at an attendancerequired educational conference. 39/70 (56%) of residents returned the survey. The survey revealed that a significant number of residents had engaged in less than ideal standards of professionalism at some time and that many residents had observed unprofessional behavior by attending physicians. Based on the results of this survey, one of the authors (RM) wrote nine clinical cases involving ethical or professional dilemmas faced by residents that were infrequently addressed in our program. Topics addressed in these scenarios included respect for patients (specifically use of disparaging comments or labels), placing patient care needs above individual physician's needs, working through conflicts with other admitting services, providing medical care to a family member or significant other, inter-professional relationships with consulting residents, appropriate means of dealing with non-compliant patients who frequently bounce, patient ownership when one resident admits a patient to another team's service, appropriate use of social media, and appropriate use of cut-and-paste function in the electronic health record. All of the scenarios also discussed responding to colleagues (including faculty) who were observed to engage in the unprofessional conduct highlighted in the case. Once per month instead of our usual morning report, one resident chose two or three cases of their choice and led discussion with residents and students. Faculty were invited to attend, but the chief resident requested that their input be restricted to posing questions instead of leading discussions. Over the course of twelve months, all cases were discussed at least once. Cases discussing respect for patients and appropriate use of social media were especially popular and chosen for over 50% of the sessions. Compared to our regular ethics conferences, these sessions were better attended and had more discussion by medical students. Conclusions: Resident-led discussion of resident-generated scenarios addressed perceived gaps in professionalism education in our internal medicine training program. Respect for patients and appropriate use of social media were the most frequently discussed topics.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Hosp Med. 2012 Mar;7 Suppl 2:S1-S323. doi: 10.1002/jhm.1927.

However, these curricula often fail to achieve optimal learning outcomes, perhaps because they neglect various contextual factors in the learning environment. The purpose of the study was to develop and validate an instrument to characterize the environment for EBM learning and practice in residency programs. METHODS: An EBM Environment Survey was developed by identifying content domains, generating a pool of possible items, review by content experts and a focus group of chief residents, and iterative item reduction. All items required responses on a 5-point Likert scale. A low score represented unfavorable perceptions of the EBM environment (possible scores 1.0 to 5.0). The 48-item survey was administered, via the internet, to residents in 6 programs (four internal medicine, one family medicine, one pediatrics) at 4 training sites. Internal consistency was analyzed with Cronbach's coefficient alpha. Validity was assessed by comparing predetermined subscales with the survey's internal structure as assessed via factor analysis. Scores were also compared for subgroups based on residency program affiliation, residency training year, gender, and prior EBM training. RESULTS: One-hundred-twenty-four of 262 residents completed the survey (response rate 47%). The overallmean EBMenvironment perception score was 3.89 (standard deviation 0.56). The initial analysis of the 48 item scale showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach a=0.94). Factor analysis and further item reduction resulted in a shorter 36-item scale without compromised internal consistency (Cronbach a = 0.86). Factor analysis reflected the pre-identified structure of 7 factors, which accounted for 63.57% of the variance. These factors reflected aspects of the EBM environment: Situational Cues, Learner Role, Utility and Accountability, Learning Culture, Resource Availability, Learning Support, and Social Support. Scores differed significantly (p<0.05) by residency program affiliation (range 3.51 to 4.13) and were higher with prior EBM training in medical school (4.14 vs.3.62) and in residency (4.25 vs.3.69). CONCLUSIONS: In initial psychometric testing, the EBM Environment Survey exhibited evidence of adequate internal consistency, internal structure validity, and discriminative validity. If further testing confirms its properties, it may be used to understand the influence of the learning environment on the effectiveness of EBM training. Additionally, it may detect changes in the EBM learning environment in response to programmatic or institutional interventions.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Gen Intern Med. 2010 Jun;25 Suppl 3:S205-567. doi: 10.1007/s11606-010-1338-5.

MP residents must negotiate the domains of two separate specialties including differing expectations of supervision and autonomy, both essential aspects of training. It has been shown that MP residents perceive significant differences in the autonomy they experience in the two specialties, with MP residents more likely to agree that they receive appropriate autonomy while on IM rotations. Previous research has also shown that MP residents are more likely to agree that they receive too little oversight on IM compared to pediatrics. It is not known whether categorical peers share MP residents' perceptions, or how resident perceptions compare to those of faculty. METHODS: Three institutions with IM, Pediatrics, and MP training programs agreed to participate: (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Maryland Medical Center, and Christiana Care Health System and Nemours/DuPont Children's Hospital). An online survey previously developed for use with MP residents was modified and pilot-tested on faculty and chief resident volunteers. Categorical IM and pediatrics residents received a survey with specialty specific questions. MP residents received a survey containing identical question blocks for both specialties. The block with which a combined respondent began the survey was randomized in an attempt to avoid bias within the MP respondents. A similar procedure was taken for faculty, with the exception of dual-trained faculty who were only provided questions for both specialties if they consistently attended on both specialties. The study was approved as IRB Exempt by UPMC. Data was analyzed descriptively and where appropriate with t tests using Stata 13.1. RESULTS: MP residents perceived significant differences in the autonomy they received between the two specialties. MP residents were more likely to agree that they received an appropriate level of autonomy while on IM rotations, with a mean score of 4.3 on 5 point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree), relative to pediatric rotations (mean of 2.7, p<0.001). There was no difference in the general perception of MP residents compared to their IM peers (means 4.3 and 4.4, p=0.47), which is in contrast to a significant difference between the perceptions of MP residents to their pediatric resident peers (means 2.7 and 4.0, p<0.001). IM and MP residents (means 2.1, 2.5) in turn had similar perceptions of their autonomy compared to their categorical IM and MP faculty (means 2.4, 2.6) who attend on the generalist wards (p values >0.05). However, MP residents were significantly more likely to agree that they received too little oversight on IM relative to their categorical peers (means 2.5 and 2.1, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: MP residents generally had similar perceptions of the level of autonomy they receive to their categorical IM peers and agreed they received an appropriate amount of autonomy, but were more likely to perceive too little oversight on the specialty than their categorical IM peers. These results may be related to the ability of MP residents to directly compare between the two specialties, but further study is required to determine whether, how, and for whom the expectations of or practice of oversight should be modified.","Suppl. 2     Cn4fv     2195687     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Previous studies have demonstrated deficiencies in resident comfort and/or education about WOLS, which can be remedied by using protocolized order sets, pocket cards or educational sessions.We aimed to describe self-identified domains of discomfort with WOLS for internal medicine and neurology residents rotating in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of two university hospitals. METHODS: We designed a 10-question, web-based survey that addressed five WOLS domains: identifying symptoms, prescribing medications, processes of WOLS (e.g. removing equipment, providing support), changing code status, and overall comfort. The survey was developed after literature review, pre-testing with a committee of intensivists, and cognitive interviewing with four chief residents.The survey (scored on a 5-point Likert scale;1=very uncomfortable, 5=very comfortable), was administered to internal medicine and neurology residents between August-November 2012 and December 2013-February 2014 at two university hospitals, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 238 residents were surveyed from two hospitals with a 69% return rate (n=164). Respondents by post-graduate year (PGY) were as follows: 58 (36%) PGY-1, 57 (35%) PGY-2, 46 (29%) PGY-3, 6 (4%) PGY-4 and 3 (2%) were unspecified. Eighty-five (52%) of all residents reported overall discomfort with WOLS. Areas of significant discomfort for all residents included: entering WOLS ventilator orders (n=87, 53%), accessing grief support (n=76, 46%) or spiritual support (n=80, 46%), deciding which interventions to withdraw (n=88, 54%), understanding when an advance directive goes into effect (n=77, 47%) and discussing psychosocial or spiritual implications regarding code status (n=82, 50% and n=97 (59%), respectively). For these areas, discomfort was spread evenly across PGY years. Less than 40% of residents reported discomfort in the domains of identifying symptoms (e.g. pain, dyspnea) or prescribing medications (e.g. opioids, sedatives; data not shown) but the most discomfort was reported with identifying constipation (n=68, 41% of all residents) and prescribing anti-secretory agents (n=75, 46% of all residents). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a need to improve resident comfort with the WOLS process. Residents were most uncomfortable with processes of WOLS (e.g. accessing support services, providing grief, spiritual or cultural support, deciding which interventions to withdraw) and most comfortable identifying symptoms and prescribing medications for WOLS. Our data will inform a tailored quality improvement WOLS intervention that will target the areas of self-reported discomfort.","Do2aw     A3763     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Our objectives were to: 1) Make this training wholly interprofessional; 2) Systematically integrate the Institute of Healthcare Improvement's triple aim (better health, better healthcare, lower cost), QI components, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Methods: Using an IP (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, social work, QI, and public health) faculty, we: 1) Reviewed curricular components, building to IP competencies and integrating the triple aim; 2) Used IP faculty as facilitators in case-based discussions and mini-lectures; 3) Incorporated our Integrated Health System's QI priorities into CR project planning; 4) Invited key institutional leaders to deliver talks embodying the triple aim. Results: Twenty-eight CRs from 13 departments participated. Baseline/Post Training evaluations (measured on a 5-point scale) showed increased confidence in the care of older patients (mean change from 3.30 to 3.89), and teaching and facilitation skills (mean change from 3.39 to 4.04). CRs reported an appreciation of the usefulness of IP teams (mean of 4.23), and an increased interest in geriatrics (mean change from 3.11 to 3.75). One CR summed up his experience: I had a wonderful time interacting with multiple specialties; this experience gives us all excellent insight. Conclusions: We educated CRs about value-based cost-conscious care, and linked them to key interprofessional staff to build team-based care. Together they addressed QI issues identified by the Network.

The role of chief resident of flow (Flow Chief) was developed in 2015 with 4 areas of focus - flow management, patient safety, resident education, and quality improvement. OBJECTIVE: Describe the evolving role of the Flow Chief and its impact on discharge barriers. METHODS: One of the main functions of the flow chief is facilitating communication between nursing/ancillary staff, residents, faculty, and administration to improve hospital throughput. Daily activities entail identifying and resolving inpatient discharge obstacles along with assistance and dissemination of information on patient throughput to residents. The accumulation of discharge barrier data has facilitated larger scale interventions and identification of trends over time. RESULTS: A total of 463 barriers have been addressed. The 3 main obstacles have been delayed imaging orders, consultant recommendations, and provider discharge responsibilities (patient instructions, home prescriptions, discharge order, and primary team rounding). Analysis has allowed for prioritization of frequent barriers and focus on specialties with higher barrier burdens. Summative reports were created for individual specialties and presented to service leadership and hospital administration. The reports also included recommendations focused on increasing efficiency and effectiveness for their common barriers. Along with summaries, annual longitudinal projects have been developed to address high priority matters related to discharges. The initial year sought to facilitate the efficiency and quality of asthma discharges. The second year has aimed to address coordination of discharges for congenital heart patients. CONCLUSION: A chief resident with recent frontline provider experience can be an effective conduit for coordination of care to facilitate discharges throughout the hospital system. These open lines of communication foster a better inpatient experience, improved quality, favorable financial impact, and informative resident atmosphere.","L617343803     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>true}"

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 500 consecutive patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy and subsequent radical prostatectomy. Transrectal ultrasound operators were stratified based on level of training as junior, senior, chief, fellow or staff. Linear regression was performed to analyze the effect of training level on volume estimates. A weighted Kappa statistic evaluated agreement between biopsy and pathological Gleason scores while an adjusted cumulative logistic regression model analyzed the effects of training level.     Results: A total of 482 patients were included in the final analysis. Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy was performed by staff in 78 (16%) patients, by fellows in 18 (4%), chief residents in 48 (10%), senior residents in 126 (26%) and junior residents in 212 (44%). There was no significant difference between transrectal ultrasound and radical prostatectomy specimen volume estimates among the training levels. Level of training was not significantly associated with pathological features, including Gleason score, primary Gleason grade, highest single Gleason grade and estimated tumor volume. Study limitations include the retrospective design and the variability among members of the same group.     Conclusions: Agreement between biopsy and pathological Gleason scores is high for all levels of training.

N. and Buckhold, F. R. and Miller, T. M. and Tad-y, D. and Combs, B.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000392201603240,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: The practice of high-value, patient-centered care is a key competency for medical trainees and providers. However, there is high variability in how and to what extent these principles have been incorporated at individual institutions. We sought to implement an educational conference format that would 1) Enable recognition of medical overuse as a significant barrier to high-value care, 2) Provide a forum for participants to analyze the drivers of medical overuse and underuse, and 3) Diagnose shortcomings in care delivery to identify individual and systems-level opportunities to enhance the value of patient care SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: RightCare Rounds is an adaptation of the familiar case conference format and thus is appropriate for a multitude of settings including morning report and grand rounds. The intended audience is any group with need for heightened awareness of the detrimental effects of medical overuse and underuse on the delivery of high-value care. While our initial focus has been on medical trainees, RightCare Rounds is appropriate for audiences composed of trainees, faculty, private practitioners or any combination of those groups. DESCRIPTION: RightCare Rounds is an initiative promoting a new paradigm of doing as much as possible for the patient and as little as possible to the patient. Initially conceived by the Lown Institute, an organization determined to improve value of care through elimination of unnecessary medical treatment, RightCare Rounds transforms the familiar case presentation format to facilitate an evidence-based discussion with the goal of improving value and promoting appropriate patient care. This initiative was promoted nationally to chief residents from several specialties as part of an educational program aimed at improving awareness around the origins and harms related to low-value care. RightCare Rounds is structured to address the whole patient and the entire continuum of care providing a unique opportunity to reflect more deeply on patient preferences, social or cultural contexts and systems-level dysfunction that is often business as usual. It also explores the many drivers of overuse and underuse that may obstruct appropriate medical care. RightCare Rounds borrows on the traditional case presentation model and uses a familiar cause and effect diagram, or RightCare Fishbone, to identify the drivers of lowvalue care. This familiarity and adaptability allow RightCare Rounds to be tailored to each programs' need and can be used to explore these issues in both inpatient and outpatient environments. By providing a venue for discussion and tools for analysis, RightCare Rounds enables practitioners to translate lessons from the conference to their own practice. EVALUATION: RightCare Rounds has been presented to audiences at division and department Grand Rounds and as noon conference to graduate medical education trainees. Qualitative information has been obtained from surveys of the audience members. The survey was created by the Lown Institute for evaluation of RightCare Rounds and includes questions asking the respondents level of agreement with statements such as this conference effectively discussed the drivers of overuse/underuse, and this conference uncovered opportunities for improving quality of care. Respondents could choose one of 4 responses: agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree and disagree. Also respondents were asked if the information from RightCare Rounds was useful in their practice answered as yes or no. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: In the past year, RightCare Rounds has been adopted as part of the curricula at 32 residency programs across a range of specialties including internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and general surgery. To date, survey data from three presentations at two institutions is available. An internal medicine Grand Rounds with 33 respondents was notable for 97 % favorable rating (agree or somewhat agree) to the statement this conference eff ctively discussed the drivers of overuse/underuse. Similarly 94 % of respondents gave favorable ratings to this conference uncovered opportunities for improving quality of care. 88 % of the respondents found the information applicable to their practice. For two presentations to a total of 27 internal medicine residents, there were unanimous favorable ratings to the same statements and unanimous agreement that the information was applicable to their practice. These data suggest that the RightCare Rounds format is easily implemented and well received by medical trainees. Most trainees noted that issues pertaining to medical overuse and underuse were directly applicable to daily practice. As training programs look for innovative ways to promote competencies in high value care, the positive responses to RightCare Rounds obtained thus far indicate RightCare Rounds is an effective means to address this unmet need.","Suppl. 2     Ei0yl     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

METHODS: This national survey consisted of US pediatric residents completing an investigator-designed questionnaire in spring 2016 on their comfort level and knowledge of autism based on the American Board of Pediatrics content specifications for general pediatrics. The survey included questions involving residents' knowledge and comfort level managing children with autism. Comfort level was measured using a 4- item scale for ASD, which demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.82). RESULTS: A total of 1700 US-based pediatric residents completed the survey. 38.2% of respondents were in their first year of training, 31.3% second year, 24.8% third year, and 5.8% were either chief residents or 4th year residents. 44.6% reported plans to go into primary care, while the remainder reported interest in pursuing subspecialties. Multiple linear regression revealed that more educational opportunities for ASD, increased residency training level, and higher numbers of patients with ASD seen were all associated with increased comfort level in managing ASD (all p<.001). No significant difference was noted in the comfort level or knowledge of those who were going into primary care versus specialty care, program size, or program type. Of respondents in their final year of residency, only 66% reported that their training program prepared them well for managing patients with ASD. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of pediatric residents in their final year of training reported that their residency did not prepare them well for managing ASD. Increased educational opportunities and patient exposure in residency were associated with improved comfort level in managing children with ASD. These findings suggest increased educational and clinical experiences surrounding ASD during residency may increase the comfort level of pediatric residents managing patients with ASD.","L617343975     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Methods: Phase1-we developed (using Delphi Method with Canadian experts) and distributed a questionnaire to 1) physicians, nurses & respiratory therapists involved in resuscitating children across Canada, 2) program directors & chief residents of Royal College residency programs in paediatrics, emergency medicine, paediatric emergency medicine and paediatric critical care medicine. Phase2-weconducted a consensus videoconference with representatives of organizations with a stake in resuscitation in Canada, using a modified nominal group technique. Results: Our questionnaire response rate was 56% (647/1151). At the consensus video- (Table presented) conference, the following recommendation was agreed upon: participation in regular simulated resuscitation events (either high or low fidelity) should be mandatory, as part of ongoing education of resuscitation team members. Conclusion: There is differential access of high-fidelity simulation equipment, with emergency medicine residency programs having more access than paediatric programs. Non-tertiary care centres (where most of the RN/RRT respondents worked) do not have as much access to high-fidelity equipment as tertiary centres (where the residency programs are located) but do organize mock codes occasionally, presumably making use of low- fidelity equipment. None of the respondent groups reported a high rate of participating in or of fering frequent (>1/month) mock code sessions. Overall, there exists an opportunity for more frequent practice of resuscitation skills at all paediatric health care centres (using either high- or low-fidelity equipment), which would allow health care providers more opportunity to practice rarely used, but important clinical skill.","L70418798     2011-05-23 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

These criteria include number and variety of operative cases and bedside procedures, critical care experience, scholarly activity, acting as an effective team member, participation in quality and/or patient safety initiatives, and, specifically, knowledge of burn physiology and initial burn management, and the metabolic response to burn injury. This study examines the experiences of first and third year surgical residents on a burn surgery rotation. Methods: Burn registry data, surgical resident case log data, resident scholarly activity, and surgical residency curriculum were analyzed and tabulated over a three-year period of time. Results: Surgical residents rotated on the burn service at a regional burn center for one month during post-graduate year one (PGY-1) and for three months during PGY-3. Mean major case numbers for PGY-1 and PGY-3 residents were 27 and 124 cases respectively. Most of these cases were burn excision and skin grafting procedures. Residents also performed an average of 4 tracheotomies, 5 bronchoscopies, and 14 central venous catheter placements over both rotations. PGY-1 and PGY-3 residents cared for a mean of 80 and 238 patients including 20 and 60 critical care patients. The PGY-3 resident served as chief resident on the burn service coordinating care among multiple specialties and subspecialties and learners at multiple levels including junior residents and medical and other students. The PGY-3 resident chaired a weekly multidisciplinary conference involving these specialists and subspecialists. These experiences provided a robust multisource evaluation of the PGY-3 resident. These residents participated in 3 burn-specific quality improvement projects, and 2 burn-specific patient safety projects. The PGY-3 residents attended the monthly burn continuous quality improvement committee meeting. The PGY-1 and PGY-3 residents were the focal point of a large multidisciplinary team responsible for patient care on the burn service. Conclusions: A burn surgery rotation provided a rich and varied experience for PGY-1 and PGY-3 residents. Residents performed a large number of major operative cases and bedside procedures. They also to participated in and lead a large multidisciplinary team. They participated in numerous scholarly activity and research projects, and experienced several burn-specific quality and patient safety initiatives. Burn surgery should be incorporated into the general surgery curriculum as a core component. Applicability of Research to Practice: The study demonstrates the educational benefits of a burn surgery rotation and concludes that burn surgery should be a core component of surgical resident education.","L71949631     2015-07-21 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

METHODS AND MATERIALS: During the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015, the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology (ARRO) conducted an electronic survey of post-graduate year-5 radiation oncology residents in the United States during the final 3 months of training. Descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: Sixty-six chief residents completed the survey in 2013 to 2014 (53% response rate), and 69 completed the survey in 2014 to 2015 (64% response rate). Forty to 85% percent of residents reported inadequate exposure to high-dose rate and low-dose rate brachytherapy. Nearly all residents in both years (>90%) reported adequate clinical experience for the following disease sites: breast, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, and lung. However, as few as 56% reported adequate experience in lymphoma or pediatric malignancies. More than 90% of residents had participated in retrospective research projects, with 20% conducting resident-led prospective clinical trials and 50% conducting basic science or translational projects. Most chief residents reported working 60 or fewer hours per week in the clinical/hospital setting and performing fewer than 15 hours per week tasks that were considered to have little or no educational value. There was more than 80% compliance with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) work hour limits.

K.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000440259000147,English,,,"BACKGROUND: Service is intrinsic to patient care. However, recent ACGME resident survey questions about service and education imply a conflicting relationship between the two and seem to equate service with scut. This study uses clinical vignettes to investigate this question and aims to (1) investigate resident and faculty perceptions of service and education (2) ascertain what aspects of patient care positively and negatively affect perceptions, and (3) evaluate perceptions of how the program balances service and education.' METHODS: This cross-sectional study design used clinical vignettes to investigate resident and faculty perceptions of service and education at a medium-sized university-affiliated community internal medicine program. We used an anonymous electronic survey instrument to collect qualitative and quantitative data responses. Participants for the study were recruited from the following groups: Internal Medicine Trainees (IMT) (81 residents, chief residents and fellows) and Teaching Faculty (TF) (50 core faculty and program leaders). Analyses included quantitative and qualitative assessments. Main themes were identified from vignette comments and multiple choice questions to showcase how residents and faculty conceptualize service and education. Likert scale data were collapsed into a 4-point scale (strongly disagree/ disagree, neutral, agree/strongly disagree, not applicable). RESULTS: Eighty participants completed surveys for an overall response rate of 61% (N=45; 56% IMT; N = 35; 70% TF). Overall, 21% of respondents perceived that excessive service obligations negatively impacted the learning environment, with trainees being significantly more likely than faculty to report agreement with this statement (33% vs 6%, respectively; p = .001). Trainees were also significantly more likely than faculty to agree that excessive service obligations contributed to duty hour violations (21% vs 6%, respectively; p = .03) in their program. With some notable exceptions, faculty and trainees generally agreed on the relative service and educational values of vignette activities. Several activities ranked high in terms of both service and educational value, such as running a family meeting and seeing an urgent care clinic patient. Both quantitative and qualitative responses suggested that high service activities fell into two main categories: tasks that could easily be completed by non-physicians and patient care with little autonomy. For example, the top 4 reported choices in a list of activities that constituted inappropriate or excessive service obligations were: calling insurance companies for prior authorizations (N=56), caring for pts when you have little autonomy (33), completing forms for patients (30), and making clinic appointments for patients at discharge (29). CONCLUSIONS: Service and education are not mutually exclusive. Residents perceive maximal education and service value in situations involving both complexity and connection.","Suppl. 2     Go7oj     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Currently, students learn this procedure at the bedside, from residents who have had no formal instruction in optimal teaching methods. METHODS: A quasi-experimental time-sequential static group study. Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) residents were exposed to a RaT curriculum consisting of a didactic session, an OSTE using a standardized student and NOELLE birthing simulator. Third-year medical students on the 6-week OBGYN clerkship logged all vaginal delivery experiences during academic years preceding and following the RaT curriculum, recording their level of involvement in each of 16 procedural steps (Likert-type scale: 15Observed; 25Assisted; 35Performed with assistance; 45Performed without assistance). The level of involvement ratings for each procedural step, were compared pre and post RaT intervention, using the x2 test. P<.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 240 and 204 delivery experiences, were recorded by students pre and post the RaT curriculum, respectively. Following the curriculum, a significantly greater proportion of student delivery experiences occurred with chief residents (PGY-4) than prior to the curriculum (19.6% versus 4.6%, P<.01).

We designed a progressive curriculum with PGY-specific objectives in the context of a specific theme (Curriculum Year 1 - geriatric assessment; Year 2 - transitions in care). Geriatric clinical experiences were PGY-specific (e.g., PGY1 - skilled nursing facility, PGY2 - geriatric clinic, PGY3 - home visit and Elder Services). A PGY4 chief resident designed a geriatric morning report as his CRIT project. Residents also completed a formative COVE-PIM chart review of their continuity clinic patients. These were added to primary care didactics, quality improvement project, and continuity and subspecialty clinics. An online Wiki was created as a resource for schedules, lectures, and independent assignments. Results: The ACB pilot year included 28 PGY1 and 29 PGY2 residents. Feedback from residents and faculty was quite positive and 90.5% of the residents agreed or strongly agreed that the integrated ACB was a better learning experience than the previous separate components. Feedback led to changes in clinical site scheduling, required online modules, and structure of the EBM session in the second year of this rotation. Conclusions: A geriatric medicine curriculum was successfully integrated into an ambulatory block rotation for Medicine residents. Now in its second year the block has been expanded to include PGY3 residents and a new set of didactic sessions and home care clinical experiences for what will eventually be a three year rotating curriculum. Overall, we found a valuable geriatric medicine experience may be incorporated into the ambulatory curriculum for Medicine residents.","Suppl. 4 Sp. Iss.

The aim of this workshop was to improve resident competence using real-time simulations by focusing on communication and team-leading skills, as well as reviewing common scenarios often encountered at rapid responses. Methods: This prospective cohort design was comprised of 2nd and 3rd year Internal Medicine residents at our institution. Residents were assigned to mixed PGY-year groups of 4 and underwent two 1-hour sessions, with a total of 4 scenarios, using the Heart-Sim® simulator. Each session was led by a Critical Care attending, a critical care fellow and an Internal Medicine chief resident. During the workshop, residents each had the opportunity to lead a team and to participate as team members, followed by a brief feedback session after each scenario. Residents were asked to complete a survey prior to starting the first session and again at the end of the second encounter. The survey assessed level of confidence in running a rapid response and when dealing with each of the following topics: 1) decision to intubate a patient, 2) stabilizing a patient in shock and 3) titrating BiPAP in acute respiratory failure. Results: A total of 42 residents participated in the first session and 36 in the second session. After completing the workshop, there was a significant increase in the general level of confidence in running a rapid response (p < 0.0001), deciding when it is appropriate to intubate a patient (p < 0.0001), titrating a BiPAP (p < 0.0005) and in stabilizing a patient in shock (p < 0.0001).

Objectives: Our goal was to use our established monthly trauma morbidity and mortality conference as an education opportunity not only for EM and trauma residents, but for and staff at Level 2-4 trauma centers. Methods: A simulation scenario was developed requiring stabilization and transfer to a Level 1 facility. It involved a 42 year old male working on a power line, who came in contact with a wire and fell 20 ft. He presented hypotensive and tachycardic with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14. His injuries included a tension pneumothorax, compartment syndrome of the burned arm, and hemodynamic instability secondary to a splenic laceration. In the conference room, a video screen showed four ED nurses nearby in our Sim Center discussing the ambulance report of the scenario patient. The trauma chief resident, EM chief resident, and two other residents were ambushed and asked to care for this patient. They had no prior knowledge that this would occur. En route to the simulation center, they were informed that this case was being telecast to EDs across the state and back to the conference room. At the end of the scenario, the residents returned for debriefing by the EM and trauma faculty. The conference continued to be broadcast and other facilities participated in the discussion. Results: An educational forum was established between Level 2-4 trauma centers and our Level 1 trauma center. EM and trauma faculty were able to answer management questions as they pertained to each unique site. Discussion: Our institution is the only state Level 1 trauma center.

Hypothesis: Implementation of a daily goals Door Communication Card (DCC) will improve goal alignment between members of the MDHCT. Methods: This project was conducted in a 20-bed transitional model surgical ICU in a 450-bed academic military medical center. To establish a baseline frequency of goal alignment, we asked MDHCT members to list your top four major goals for a patient on a given day. Team members queried were the ICU attending, the bedside nurse, the on-call ICU resident, and the primary surgical chief resident. After initial data collection, DCC's were placed on patients' doors. Anyone was allowed to write on the card, but the official daily goals were recorded during multidisciplinary rounds (MDR). Goal discrepancies noted during MDR were reconciled with phone calls. One month after introduction of the DCC, MDHCT members were re-queried about their goals. Three reviewers (a nurse, an ICU attending, and a resident) independently assessed goal alignment.

Training in hernia repair is still too widely characterized by the see one, do one, teach one model. The most efficient and effective educational programs are based on an assessment of learner needs and current training gaps. The goal of this study was to perform a needs assessment focused on surgical training to guide the creation of a curriculum intended to improve the care of hernia patients. Methods: This mixed methods study conducted by the SAGES Hernia Task Force (HTF) incorporated the use of selected interviews in addition to an online survey. Subjects were asked about their perceived deficits in resident training to care for hernia patients, preferred training topics about hernias, ideal learning modalities and education development. Results: 18 HTF members, 27 chief residents and fellows, and 31 surgical residents were interviewed. Among the HTF members, there was consensus that residency exposes trainees to a wide spectrum of hernia repairs by a variety of surgeons. They cited outdated materials, techniques and paucity of feedback as barriers to effective hernia education. Additionally, they identified the see one, do one, teach one method of training as prevalent and clearly inadequate. The topics least addressed were system-based approach to hernia care (46%) and patient outcomes (62%). Residents considered preoperative and intraoperative decision-making (90%), complications (94%) and technical approach for repairs (98%) to be well taught during training. Instructional methods used in residency include assisted/supervised surgery (96%), web-based learning (24%), and simulation (30%). Residents' preferred learning methods included simulation (82%), web based training (61%), hands on laboratory (54%) and videos (47%), in addition to supervised surgery. Trainees reported their most desired training topics as basic techniques for inguinal and ventral hernia repairs (41%) vs. 68% who wanted advanced technical training. These numbers mirror those reported by attending surgeons, 36% and 71%, respectively. Conclusions: Consensus exists among HTF members and surgical trainees regarding the lack of standardization in training and care, inadequate patient follow-up and poor outcome measures for hernia repair. A comprehensive, dynamic and flexible educational program using a variety of instructional methods to address key deficits in the care of hernia patients would be welcomed by surgeons.","eng     Germany     Surg Endosc. 2015 Apr;29 Suppl 1:410-547. doi: 10.1007/s00464-015-4130-0.

In addition, contemporary european health services are confronted with a growing diversity according to language, country of origin, education, and/or religious beliefs. At the Department of Ambulatory Care and Community Medicine in Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, half of the patients are immigrant. The first attempts to manage diversity emerged 15 years ago, and included the development of a cultural competence (CC) curriculum for frontline medical doctors. In 2010, a survey showed that their self-perceptions of CC skillfulness was low and that their CC needed strengthening. New education strategies have therefore been implemented. Our main objective was to improve the clinical impact of CC education efforts. The secondary objective was to increase the perceived relevance of CC care, among providers. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Department of Ambulatory Care and Community Medicine is an academic center comprised of 100 physicians. During residency training, a mandatory 4 h CC education module is in place, based on traditional and moderately interactive teaching media (clinical encounter videos, powerpoint, case vignettes). The first session focuses on adressing language and literacy issues, the second session on social context, and the third on beliefs and stereotypes. The fourth and final session emphasizes learned/prior principles through clinical cases. Prior to these efforts, only oral or written patient cases had been used. The target populations are general medicine residents and chief residents. The trainer is an attending physician. DESCRIPTION: A pilot experience was supported by an education-innovation grant from Lausanne University and took place in September 2013. It focused on the 90 min fourth session of the module and was developed in accordance with a patientbased approach in a simulated interactive and supervised clinical environment. Two clinical scenarios were created based on an « upstream evaluation » of learners' needs. The first case involves a young Moroccan student with an undiagnosed gonococcal throat infection. Prejudice, sexual risk behaviour and sexual orientation were addressed in this vignette. The second case is about a 40 year old Albanian woman presenting with somatoform disorders. Treatment adherence, social integration and gender were touched upon in this segment. The following specific skills were integrated in the scenarios : to determine the socio-cultural factors affecting medical care; to identify a patient's understanding of his/her illness; to show the learner how to « teach-back »; to negociate a treatment plan. Two simulated patients were trained for the role plays. A duration of 45 min was alloted to each case, this included group debriefing and a post-debriefing role play. Development of the session was supervised by a collaborative, interdisciplinary team of medical doctors, CC care specialists and educationists. Eleven physicians participated, five of them volunteered for the role play, and the rest were active observers. EVALUATION: The experience was initially evaluated by an ad hoc form distributed directly after the session. Nine out of ten learners (n=10, 1 missing) rated their satisfaction as « very satisfied ». Eight out of ten considered that simulated patients helped them improve their CC and that the class increased their comprehension of CC. One month later, a focus group reunited six of the learners to complete these results. Clinical cases and simulated patients were considered « realistic » and the increased opportunities for interaction in the class were highly appreciated. The application of CC through a simulated environment was considered advantages in increasing self-reflection and improving individual provider practice. Specific and planned improvements include 1) more time dedicated to the group debriefing, and 2) adding a discussion about the potential consequences of the generalisation of population groups related to CC learning ases. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: The use of simulated patients has long been used in medical education. However, to our knowledge, this project is one of the few uses of simulated patients in a CC curriculum. Getting past a traditional CC curriculum and offering an educational setting that insists on interactivity, self reflection and real clinical practice is a relevant way to match the triad at the heart of CC « knowledge, attitude and skills ». As globalisation makes CC essential for medical practice, other settings are encouraged to take advantage of this international example : using innovative teaching medium adapted to the local contextual issues about diversity.","Suppl. 1     Ao0jz     Times Cited:1     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

An online survey of 18 questions was sent to all general surgery residency program directors in the United States between April and June of 2013 via e-mail.

Of the 202 delivered, 85 program directors were responded (42%). Seventy-eight per cent of programs classified a resident as surgeon junior whether the resident completed more than 50 per cent of the case. Most classified autonomy as either the resident completing > 75 per cent of a case (41%) or completing the critical steps of a surgery (41%). Eighty-eight per cent stated that chief residents completed the majority of cases under supervision, whereas only 12 per cent stated the chief had autonomy in the operating room and also acted as teaching assistant. While, 60 per cent stated their chief residents did not work in any area of the hospital independently. Despite differences in how autonomy is defined among programs, most program directors feel that their chief residents do not achieve complete autonomy. Programs should allow their residents to work in a progressive responsibility as they progress into their fourth and fifth years of residency to achieve autonomy.","Cq4gg     Times Cited:5     Cited References Count:9 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Methods: A retrospective study of all the patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy in our department between the years 2000-2008 was conducted. The patients were operated upon by novice surgeons, chief residents, and senior surgeons. Pre-operative variables were compared, as well as surgical outcomes and complications. Results: During the study period 477 laparoscopic appendectomies were performed on 320 women and 157 men with a mean age of 39 years. In 11 cases (2.3%) conversion to an open surgery was conducted. No differences were found regarding pre-operative patient status and the rate of accurate pre-operation diagnosis in comparison with the pathological report in all groups. The rates of conversion, postoperative complications, and negative appendectomies were similar between residents and seniors. These findings were also found in a sub-group analysis in which we compared each group (residents vs. chief residents vs. seniors). Conclusions: There is no additional risk in a laparoscopic appendectomy done by a resident, whether it is a chief or a novice. Laparoscopic appendectomy is a good model for training young surgeons in laparoscopic skills: it enables the young surgeon to engage and lead more advanced cases, and does not imbue any additional risk upon the patient.","L70470703     2011-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

To help with this we have developed a laparoscopic simulation curriculum using lectures, inanimate models and animal models to provide training and assessment of all six of the ACGME core competencies. METHODS: We have developed a progressive surgical simulation curriculum with quarterly labs involving didactic instruction, inanimate simulation and live tissue models (swine animal models) to increase realism. We have developed graduated, graded checklists for each operation and 360 degree evaluations that address all six ACGME core competencies. Faculty evaluations and surgical times are recorded for each procedure to record progress and skills improvement. These data were analyzed for successive labs with the student t test to evaluate for improvement. RESULTS: Senior and chief residents score higher than do junior residents obtaining exceeds expectations in 50% of evaluations in all domains of the 360 degree evaluations while junior residents score lower with 35% exceeds expectations on the initial labs. These evaluations improve with later labs to 67% and 46 % respectively (p < 0.017). Faculty score evaluations improve with subsequent labs as well with senior residents scoring performed independently in 73% of steps and junior residents scoring 53% on initial labs and improving to 92% and 67% on later labs respectively (p < 0.049). The initial times to complete a laparoscopic nephrectomy for senior and chief residents average 188 minutes and more junior residents 288 minutes. These times improved significantly to 125 minutes and 133 minutes on later labs respectively. All components of the operation take longer without a specific improvement in one section of the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that this intergraded simulation curriculum promotes significant resident skills progression. By incorporating the whole faculty and staff into the evaluation process we find that this comprehensive approach affords multiple opportunities for resident evaluation in all 6 domains of the core competencies. This also allows quantifiable and documentable progression of the trainee along the learning curve in a safe environment. Additionally, training residents with simulation may allow us to better understand how surgeons acquire skills and help us to more effectively train the next generation of surgeons.","422sr     2182     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

As the available number of jobs has increased, however, the number of pediatric radiology fellows has declined. This study examines the recent supply and demand for pediatric radiologists as well as implications for fellows and employers moving forward. Methods & Materials: The Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR) and American College of Radiology (ACR) Career Centers were analyzed each day from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. Job advertisements for fellowship positions were excluded. Fellowship occupation rates were derived from data reported by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Projected fellowship interest was assessed using chief-resident-derived survey data from the American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology. Results: There were 97 unique full-time attending-level jobs for pediatric radiologists advertised on the SPR Career Center during the 2016-2017 academic year. of these openings, 72% were advertised by universities or free-standing children's hospitals. Distinct peaks in job openings in November 2016 and March 2017 were apparent. Positions were posted for a median of 2 months and an average of 2.9 months. California and Texas were the states with the most openings. There were 96 jobs for pediatric radiologists posted on the ACR Career Center with a daily average of 16.2 pediatric radiology jobs, representing 3% of the average number of total diagnostic radiology jobs. The number of total jobs and pediatric radiology jobs have continued to increase in 2017. There were less than 2 pediatric radiology fellows for every 3 advertised positions in 2016-2017. Progressive declines in the number of pediatric fellows have been observed since 2013. Resident survey data forecasts continued decreases in the number of radiology graduates opting for pediatric radiology fellowships. Conclusions: Progressive declines in the number of pediatric radiology fellows creates a favorable job market for current trainees, however, employers should expect significant declines in the number of new graduates over the coming years.

Inform future educational interventions and curriculum development in the area of LGBTQ+ health for trainees. Methods used An anonymous survey platform (Qualtrics) was used to create a survey to assess residents' perceptions of knowledge, skill, learner attitudes, and already existing learning opportunities related to LGBTQ+health issues. This survey has been sent via chief residents to both the paediatric and psychiatric residents at UF Health in Jacksonville, Florida. The results will be used as a needs assessment to help develop future educational opportunities for residents. The study is still in process with plans to disseminate the survey to programs across the country. Summary of results 27 residents have completed the survey to date. 30% of respondents were PGY-1, 48% PGY-2, 15% PGY-3, and 7% PGY-4. Of these, there were 20 (74%) paediatric residents, 6 (22%) psychiatric residents and 1 (4%) MedPeds resident. Almost all agreed that it is important to know a patient's sexual orientation and gender identity and indicated awareness that unique needs exist in regards to the healthcare of LGBTQ+youth. Residents reported minimal training, knowledge, and competence in providing care to this population regardless of training level. Additionally, residents are not familiar with some of the most common and easily available resources for LGBTQ+youth and parents. There was a change noted in residents' comfort in providing care to LGBTQ+patients from intern year to later residency years. Data collection from this survey is ongoing. Conclusions While this educational project is still in process, the data suggests a few key issues. Residents become more comfortable in taking histories and discussing sexual and gender specific concerns with LGBTQ +youth after intern year. However, self-perception of knowledge and skill level about providing care to LGBTQ +youth does not improve further into residency. Residents do not report feeling adequately trained in LGBTQ +healthcare, however do believe this training is important. There is a need for increased education in the care of LGBTQ +patients during residency and specific education should be developed based on residents' perceived needs.","Gb2xk     613     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Elmhurst Hospital Center is a city hospital affiliated with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and one of three primary sites for resident urological training. Prostate biopsies are performed in a minor operating room (OR) setting by first-year urology residents with chief resident and attending supervision. Prior to July of the first year, residents have minimal experience with ultrasound and no simulator training with transrectal US. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of time of year, a proxy for residency training, on OR procedure time for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. METHODS: The Elmhurst Hospital Center Surgical Database was queried for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy procedures from January of 2010 to December of 2012. Case duration was recorded in minutes. A student's t-test was performed to determine if OR procedure time early in the academic year was significantly different from OR procedure time late in the academic year. RESULTS: A total of 222 transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies were performed. The minimum procedure time was 5 minutes and the maximum procedure time was 85 minutes. There was a significant difference in length of procedure between July, the month in which residents had least training and June, the month in which residents had most training (p = 0.027) on twotailed t-test. Median procedure time decreased by almost fifty percent, from 20 minutes in July to 11 minutes in June. CONCLUSIONS: Resident experience is significantly associated with length of procedure in transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies. This may be related to time required for teaching and learning curve. In addition to potential patient risk related to longer procedure time, there are financial implications of increased OR time and need for staffing. Although transrectal ultrasound simulators exist, they are not widely used or required in residency training. Additional resident simulation training, specifically for procedures which utilize transrectal imaging technology, may mitigate the effects of early training on OR procedure time.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Endourol. 2013 Oct;27 Suppl 1:A1-470. doi: 10.1089/end.2013.2001.

However, in many regions there is limited availability of such personnel. We reviewed the complication rates related to PCNL access when performed at a teaching hospital to establish that access for PCNL may be safely taught to and performed by urology residents. Chief urology residents across the nation were also anonymously surveyed to better understand the current trends and dynamics regarding PCNL access in teaching institutions. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all PCNL surgeries performed at our institution from 1995 to 2009 for any complications related to surgery. Patients with access gained at outside institutions or not attempted at the time of surgery by residents were excluded. The complication rate was compared to those of the Society of Interventional Radiologists. An eight question survey was also sent by email to all current urology chief residents regarding their experience with PCNL access during residency. RESULTS: A total of 290 patients underwent PCNL surgery with 338 separate access sites gained at the time of surgery under the supervision of nine teaching staff. Access was successfully gained in all cases at the time of surgery. Major complications included: transfusion in 20 patients (5.9%), sepsis in 2 patients (.6%), pseudoaneurysm necessitating intervention in 2 patients (.6%), hydrothorax in 2 patients (.6%), pneuomothorax in 1 patient (.3%), UPJ disruption in 1 patient (.3%) and one death after surgery (.3%). Minor complications included: UTI in 5 patients (1.5%) and collecting system injuries in 6 patients (1.8%) necessitating placement of ureteral stent. Our survey of residents demonstrated that over 65% did not routinely gain access for PCNL surgery at their institution. However, 91% who did not get instruction on PCNL access felt it would be a valuable addition to their training. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that access for PCNL surgery can be safely and successfully obtained by GU residents under the supervision of trained staff at the time of surgery. We feel that access for PCNL surgery is a valuable tool that should be in the armamentarium of all urologic surgeons upon leaving an accredited urology training program.","L70145255     2010-05-25 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

However, infrastructure to capture problems that residents encounter as frontline caregivers can be sub-optimal. Empowering residents to engage in problem resolution may be further challenged by a lack of a reliable process to solve these problems. Aim Statement Implement a resident-led quality improvement visual board at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford by August 2016 and increase resident problem reporting and resolution by 25% by the end of the academic year. Interventions In August 2016, a QI problem reporting visual board was placed in the residency common space for residents to report QI issues in four main categories (Figure 1). Residents received a 45-minute QI education session introducing the visual board. Problems were written on the board and also submitted electronically. Chief residents reviewed and responded to all submissions weekly, utilizing their knowledge of the local hospital system to guide residents towards problem resolution. Resident-identified QI issues were also discussed at weekly multidisciplinary leadership rounds and monthly residency council meetings. Measures Primary outcomes were changes in pre vs. post-intervention number, characterization and outcome of problems reported. A run chart was used to track progress. Secondary outcomes were pre vs. post QI knowledge and confidence, assessed by surveys. RESULTS: Pre-survey response rate was 86% (78/91). Residents reported low confidence in their ability to solve systems-related problems in all queried domains. After implementation of the visual board, problem reporting increased from 1/mth (pre) to 4.9/ mth (post); problems resolved increased from 0/mth (pre) to 2.3/ mth (post) (Figure 2). The majority of problems reported were EMR & Information Technology related. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS: A standardized reporting process led to an increase in resident reporting and resolution of systems- level quality problems that impact resident work flow and patient care. A post-survey will be conducted in the spring. (Figuer Presented).","L617343524     2017-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

All paediatric junior doctors in the hospital were involved and the overall goal was to improve trainee satisfaction. Problem Junior doctors in the hospital sometimes felt unable to feedback issues surrounding their work to higher management. This was reflected in the feedback provided via the National GMC survey. On carrying out a local questionnaire amongst 48 trainees, 77% felt that they were not confident enough to approach senior management regarding work-related issues. The commonest issue was regarding the rota for trainees, with 85% expressing some dissatisfaction due to large gaps without cover. Another issue highlighted by 73% was the lack of formal educational opportunities during training posts. Assessment of problem and analysis of its causes When analysed, 100% of trainees surveyed felt that having a lead registrar would make the process of feedback easier. The main root of the problem was the lack of a link person between trainees and management. Intervention The role of Chief Resident in the hospital was introduced to improve communication and enhance continuity between the management and trainee teams. The role involved being formally responsible for the following:  Delivering a robust channel of communication to and from the trainees  Regular drop in sessions to address trainees' issues regarding workplace  Providing representation of trainees at formal trust meetings including hospital management board meetings  Ad hoc one to one meeting with senior consultant colleagues regarding issues raised by or about trainee medical staff Study design This process of improvement was qualitative in nature. Questionnaires were used regularly to analyse problems and these were then addressed according to priority. Strategy for change To implement this plan, a job role for Chief Resident of the hospital was advertised internally. Interviews were carried out by a senior consultant involved in service improvement. Measurement of improvement As this was mainly a qualitative process of service improvement, questionnaires were used 3 months after the role was established to obtain feedback from trainees. 43 questionnaires were completed and 95% of trainees now felt confident that they were able to communicate issues around their training to higher management via the Chief Resident. 91% also felt that they were better informed about hospital management issues as this was being relayed to them after hospital board meetings via email communication. Effects of changes Questionnaire results have demonstrated a dramatic improvement in trainee satisfaction. Better communication between management and trainee teams has also improved the relationship between the two. Regular monthly meetings organised by the Chief Resident are now carried out between the management and trainee teams to address training issues. An active project to revise the trainees working pattern and rota structure is also being carried out, involving participation of junior doctors. Regular questionnaires every 3 months amongst trainees internally aim to assess the progress of this long-term improvement project. Lessons learnt The main lesson from this process of quality improvement is the importance of having a consistent link between trainee and management teams in a hospital. Improving trainee experience inevitably leads to safer and better patient care. Message for others Developing a formal role of Chief Resident should be considered in hospitals to improve the experience of junior doctors. Trainees should lead and address their educational needs and workplace issues with support from higher management via this system. This role should be longstanding with continual assessments, as it ultimately provides long-term service improvement.","L612211615     2016-09-21 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>true}"

Compared with qualitative assessment, it may enable more precise monitoring of resident progressive performance and may allow for systematic evaluation and targeting of specific weak areas in the curriculum, among other potential benefits. Design: Four surgical pathologists and a chief resident designed a data entry form to track correct and incorrect diagnoses, clinical significance of an incorrect diagnosis and to assess for specific components such as accuracy in margin assessment, tumor stage, IHC selection, molecular knowledge, etc. The team met twice to discuss conceptual issues. After each signout session with a resident (30-45 small cases; and up to 25 large cases/signout) the attending pathologist would complete the form. All data were entered into a custom Microsoft Access relational database. Data entry was performed by administrative staff. Results: To date, 50 resident signout sessions have been logged. The data entry form underwent four modifications to improve efficiency and reduce ambiguities. Average time required by the pathologist for completing the form was <20 minutes with average data entry time approximately 10 minutes/form. Data entry was accurate based on a cross-check of 10% of hard-copy forms with database values. The pathologists participating in the project did not find the time commitment prohibitive. The use of an Access database provided the ability to evaluate the data across numerous variables. As anticipated, more experienced residents generally showed a higher rate of accurate diagnoses. (Figure Presented) The percentage of correct diagnoses differed according to the specimen category. Pathologist variation in scoring the same resident within the same rotation was present but did not vary significantly. Conclusions: Quantitative assessment of diagnostic accuracy is feasible and appears to show consistency across pathologists scoring the same resident within the same rotation.

With the revolution in minimally invasive technologies, the medical management of conditions that were previously surgically managed, and the introduction of the 80-hour work week, the time available to residents for the development of surgical skills has become more limited. The aim of our study is to quantify the changes over time in the operative experiences of graduating residents in Obstetrics and Gynecology. DESIGN: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Resident Statistics Summary reports from the academic year 2002-2003 till the present were retrospectively reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mean number of cases performed during the chief year as the primary surgeon for both abdominal hysterectomy and vaginal hysterectomy were analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out using unpaired t tests and the analysis of variance (ANOVA). All statistical tests were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and statistical significance was set at P<0.05. RESULTS: The mean number of abdominal hysterectomies performed by a graduating resident was 89.1 in 2002-2003 as compared to 68.6 in 20092010 (P< 0.001). The mean number of vaginal hysterectomies performed by a graduating resident was 34.9 in 2002-2003 as compared to 19.7 in 2009-2010 (P< 0.001). In addition, there was a statistically significant decrease in the operative experience of graduating chief residents during the study period (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Current graduating residents are more likely to be performing fewer abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies than previous generations. To develop the technical skills required to be a competent and independently practicing gynecologic surgeon, graduating residents should consider additional fellowship training.","L70650764     2012-01-30 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Daytime floor management of surgical patients is often performed by midlevel providers. Knowledge previously acquired by experience must now be actively taught to avoid prolonging the training period. We report the feasibility of and MS opinions regarding a novelsimulated floor management course (SIMFLO) to teach three basic patient care concepts required on the surgical wards: documentation, communication and medical principles. Methods: A simulated hospital ward was populated with 3 Sim- Man3G simulators (Laerdal, Stavanger NOR) complete with physical exam findings and active vital signs. Surgical clerks gathered data during morning rounds, wrote notes and provided care for Sim- Man3G simulators throughout the duration of the course. the use of SimMan 3G also allowed students to participate in the active evaluation and treatment of a change in patient condition with nursing staff represented by participating housestaff officers. Findings and plans werecommunicated directly to their chief resident, a surgical attending, who gave them feedback on presentation style and appropriateness of plans. All patient encounters and oral presentations were recorded for future critical review. A 15-item survey was distributed to participating MS to determine attitudes and opinions about the course. Results: The course required five faculty, two medical educators, four surgical housestaff and 2. 5 hours to accommodate 40-50 students per session. Faculty and surgical housestaff oversight provided guidance and feedback on clinical skills, including information gathering, oral presentation and organization of written content to fulfill documentation requirements. Fifty students completed the survey (56% response rate). Most medical students felt that SIMFLO improved their understanding of medical management of surgical issues (33/50 (66%, 95% CI 51-79%)) and their documentation skills (39/50 (78%, 95% CI 64-88%)). Medical students reported that attending surgeon involvement made the experience more valuable (42/47 (89%, 95% CI 77-96%)) and was not intimidating (31/47 (66%, 95% CI 51-79%). Most expressed an interest in participating in more clinical scenarios (34/47 (72%, 95%CI 57-84%)). Conclusions: A simulation course for teaching patient care concepts such as SIMFLO is feasible and regarded positively by medical student participants. It is an effective method to train medical students in basic ward management of non-procedural care issues without any concerns over patient safety or anxiety. Students felt that attending surgeon involvement was fundamental to making it meaningful. Further development and use of such simulated patient care exercise may be an effective adjunct for training future housestaff and hospital staff in patient care in a time of shifting paradigms on work hours.","L70651257     2012-01-30 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

House officer responses to an alcohol-impaired physician differed depending on whether that physician was an attending physician or a house officer. Seventy-two percent of house officers would tell the chief resident about the alcohol-impaired attending physician, whereas 96% would confront the alcohol-impaired house officer personally. The most common response to the incompetent attending physician (67%) and the incompetent house officer (49%) was to tell the chief resident; only 25% would confront an incompetent house officer.

This poses dire consequences to patient care, safety, and the health care system as a whole. The American College of Graduate Medical Education has become increasingly aware of this problem, but research on the efficacy of existing interventions is limited. The internal medicine program at Rush University Medical Center has lost multiple residents to suicide within the last decade. These events have ignited a mission within the residency program to incorporate wellness into the curriculum. July 2016 marked the beginning of an intern wellness pilot program. The objective of this program was to develop a community where interns feel engaged and empowered while exploring tools designed to build resiliency skills. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Eleven interns self-selected to participate in the yearlong curriculum composed of monthly small group sessions. Once the group began, no additional interns were allowed to join. To ensure a safe environment, the group members were asked to keep information shared by any group member in confidence at all times. DESCRIPTION: Each session was one-hour in length and occurred during lunch on days when noon conference was cancelled, which guaranteed that attendees did not miss any educationalmaterial. Senior residents were asked to hold the intern pagers during these sessions to allow for uninterrupted participation. A chief resident and an internalmedicine attending, both trained by the Center for Mind Body Medicine, led each session. EVALUATION: At the end of each session, participants were given a brief anonymous survey. All data from these surveys have been compiled and averaged to date. The first question asked whether the session helped them gain new insights into residency experiences thus far; 89 percent responded yes. The second question asked whether the session helped them recognize and address personal or psychological issues affecting professional performance; 95 percent responded yes. Lastly, they were asked to rate each session as outstanding, good, fair, or poor. 75 percent found the sessions to be outstanding, and the rest rated as good. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Although a small sample size, our results suggest that our interns have benefit from smallgroup wellness-focused initiatives. Despite the overall positive evaluations thus far, the implementation of the intern wellness program has met challenges. First, scheduling issues and patient emergencies prohibited interns from attending some sessions. Even when interns were present, they were often carrying pagers and dealing with work-related matters during the sessions. Interns were reluctant to ask their seniors to cover their pagers, in part due to concern that some seniors did not understand the purpose of the wellness sessions. These are a few of the many barriers to designing a wellness curriculum at the graduate medical education level. Review of the literature suggests that these interventions may meet fewer challenges at a medical school level.","Suppl. 2     Go7oj     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

A robotic approach to minimally invasive procedures potentially confers a number of benefits ranging from a magnified viewing field to greater attenuation and translation of hand movements leading to improved stability and maneuverability. It is paramount that a robust curriculum is designed for training surgical residents in robotic techniques. The aim of this project is to assess the current state of robotic surgery training at the Ohio State University, with specific regard to whether it is currently temporally effective in addition to establishing a baseline against which the robotic surgery curriculum can be compared. Methods and Procedures: Data were obtained for 199 cases performed at the Ohio State University Hospital East, between January and September of 2017. Case time, date, type, and attending surgeon were recorded and tracked for review. Of the 199 cases, 72 were cholecystec-tomies, 40 were unilateral inguinal hernia repairs, and 36 were bilateral inguinal hernia repairs-for a total of 148 procedures included in the analysis. Chief Residents were trained in two-month blocks, beginning in January of 2017. Mean console operative times for the first and second months were compared for cholecystectomies as well as unilateral and bilateral inguinal hernia repairs. Results: Mean console time decreased for cholecystectomies (-9.0%; N=72), bilateral (-16.0%; N=36) and unilateral (-1.5%; N=40) inguinal hernia repairs from month one to month two. There was a large amount of variance across training blocks, but there was a systematic improvement in operative time across the training period. Average operation length was shortest for cholecystec-tomies (m=66.8 min), followed by unilateral inguinal hernia repairs (m=85.3 min), and finally bilateral inguinal hernia repairs (m=111.2 min). Discussion: This preliminary data suggests that residents are able to decrease their robotic operation time over the course of the two-month rotation. Although sample sizes were relatively small for each block, the consistency of the trend supports this conclusion. Further data collection will allow for more precise estimates in the future, and stronger conclusions to be drawn. These results show that rapid improvement is possible and provide motivation to establish robotic surgery curricula for general surgery residents nationally.","eng     News     Germany     Surg Endosc. 2018 Apr;32(Suppl 1):130-359. doi: 10.1007/s00464-018-6121-4.

We hypothesized that urology residents who received FLS training during their PGY1 year would improve their laparoscopic skills and retain those skills throughout their residency. Additionally, we hypothesized that the retest performance of residents with FLS training would exceed that of PGY5 urology chief residents who did not have the benefit of FLS instruction. METHODS: Eight PGY1 urology residents from 2008-2011 participated in a 5 month surgical skills training course at the beginning of their intern year. Residents spent 2 hours/week for a total of 40 hours of laparoscopic training using a regimented curriculum. Resident performance was determined using Task Completion Time (TCT) before training (Pre TCT), after 5 months (Post TCT), and during interval follow up (Retest TCT) for peg transfer (PT), circle cut (CC), extracorporeal knot tying (EC), and intracorporeal knot tying (IC) skills. Relative retention rates were calculated for each of the 4 FLS skill tasks. Two PGY5 urology chief residents who did not receive FLS training were tested on the four tasks prior to their graduation for comparison. Paired students t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS: Aggregate comparison of Pre TCT and Post TCT showed improvement in all tasks with a p<0.01. Aggregate comparison of Post TCT and Retest TCT were not statistically significant which demonstrated retention of skills. Retest TCT scores were improved over Post TCT scores across all tasks and all retest intervals. Relative retention rates were 111%, 124%, 106%, and 110% for PT, CC, EC, and IC. Post TCT times for trained residents were lower in all 4 FLS skills compared to PGY5 urology chief residents who received no FLS training. CONCLUSIONS: Urology residents receiving FLS training in their PGY1 year demonstrated significant improvement in their laparoscopic skills. Retesting data suggested retention of these skills into the subsequent years of their residency training. Furthermore, early FLS skills training provided for a laparoscopic skills set superior to urology chief residents who received no FLS training. While our sample size is small due to the nature of most urology residencies, the benefits are clear. We advocate incorporating FLS training for all urology residency programs in conjunction with developing robotic training modules to improve overall laparoscopic surgical skills acquisition and retention.","Suppl.

Historically, the interview score has accounted for 75% of the variability in rank position at our institution, and this has been reported in another study. There is little data exploring the reliability of interview scoring in emergency medicine . We sought to determine if a single global visual analog scale (VAS) to score applicants would create a broad enough spread of values to be useful while being reliable between faculty interviewers. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study performed at a community-based university-affiliated institution with 8 allopathic emergency medicine positions each year. Applicants in the 2011 pool were interviewed by 3 or 4 individuals drawn from a pool of 9 academic faculty and 1 chief resident. Interviewers scored applicants using a VAS which was 100mm long with the words «bottom of the rank list» on one side and «top of the rank list» on the other. Interviewers were instructed to place a single hash mark on the VAS corresponding to where they believed the applicant should be ranked. The distance in millimeters from the «bottom of the rank list» side was measured and recorded as the applicant's score. Interviewers had access to the applicants' academic records and board scores for 15 to 30 minutes prior to the interview. Scores by each of the 10 interviewers were compared to determine if any interviewer scored applicants consistently lower or higher than the global pool of interviewers. Each applicant's scores were analyzed for reliability among the interviewers. Regression analysis was performed on interview scores as compared to board scores as well as rank position. Scores for the entire interview season were examined through descriptive statistics. This study was institutional review board exempt. Results: Over 600 applications were received in the 2011 season, and about 100 applicants were invited to interview. 91 applicants accepted the invitation and were interviewed during the 2011 interview season. The mean interview score for these applicants was 61.9 (median 61.7) with a standard of deviation of 16.5. The 10 interviewers did not differ significantly in their scoring of applicants (ANOVA p = NS). For applicants interviewed by 4 interviewers, the intraclass correlation was 0.85. For those interviewed by 3 interviewers, the intraclass correlation was 0.84. In regression analysis of interview scores and USMLE Step 1 scores, r = 0.28 (r squared = 0.08). In regression analysis of interview scores and final rank position, r = 0.87 (r squared = 0.75). Conclusion: A global VAS provides a wide distribution of scores and is a reliable method for assessing interview applicants with 3 or 4 interviewers. Interview score was responsible for 75% of the variability in position on the rank list. There was only a weak relationship between interview score and USMLE Step 1 score. Future studies will determine if applicant interview scores correlate with clinical success in residency.","L70897200     2012-10-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

M.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559853,English,,,"SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In 2003 faculty and chief residents in the Yale Primary Care Internal Medicine Residency noted that residents had questions each year regarding career planning. Interested trainees and faculty developed a list of informational needs, which became the content outline for BR. We aimed to create a resource that would be easily accessible and updated. We combined links from other online educational resources with insights from recent graduates who contributed their lessons learned. Over 4 years we developed content through an iterative process of presentations to residents and faculty. BR was initially launched in 2007 in the Department of Medicine and placed on the Yale Medical Library site. Initial users were Yale Primary Care, Traditional, and Medicine/Pediatric residents (N=164). DESCRIPTION: The website consists of 5 sections 1) Resume or CV? 2) Getting a Job, 3) Obtaining a Fellowship, 4) The Road Not Taken, and 5) Networking. The sections include links to outside resources like the American College of Physicians site for career counseling, timeline for the application process, job alert signups, and sites for licensing and certification. BR includes suggestions for interviewing and CV writing, including a template residents can use to start their own CVs. Important considerations for job applications include financial, practice, and legal issues. The Fellowship section includes a timeline, links to the NMRP site, and suggestions for successful application process. The Road Not Taken includes discussion of lesser known fellowship and job opportunities. NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Few residencies have courses to prepare residents for careers after residency. We developed Beyond Residency (BR) to provide a unified online resource to help trainees determine career choices after residency and how to successfully obtain them. The objectives of the website were to: 1) improve access to existing resources for obtaining a job or fellowship, 2) increase knowledge about the timeline and requirements for application, and 3) decrease stress and improve satisfaction with the application process. EVALUATION: In 2009 we began a controlled trial to evaluate the impact of the site on resident stress with career planning and satisfaction with the process. We exposed 3 of 7 Yale Affiliated Hospital medicine residency programs to BR in addition to the main Yale residencies. We developed an instrument to collect demographic data, what the resident applied for, what position was secured, and experience with the application process. The survey was sent electronically to recent graduates from Yale medicine residencies in June of 2009 and 2010, including sites that were and were not exposed to BR. Seventy-five residents (response rate=37%) completed the survey; only 15 reported use of BR. There were no differences in stress or satisfaction with the application process between residents who used BR compared to those who did not. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Although we did not find effects on stress or satisfaction from BR, problems accessing online tools may have played a major role as only a minority of residents reported using BR. Some reported issues finding the site and recalling the password. Difficulties contacting recent graduates for surveys were also noted. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that some residents found the centralization of career resources helpful. Further efforts at dissemination are underway.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Gen Intern Med. 2011 May;26 Suppl 1:S1-620. doi: 10.1007/s11606-011-1730-9.

We assess the impact of resident participation on surgical outcomes using a large multi-institutional prospective database. METHODS: Relying on the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) Participant User Files (2005-2011), we abstracted the 3 most frequently performed minimally-invasive urologic oncology procedures. These included radical prostatectomy, radical nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to assess the impact of trainee involvement (PGY 1-2: junior, PGY 3-4: senior, PGY >/=5: chief) versus attending-only on operative time, length-of-stay, 30-day complication, reoperation and readmission rates. RESULTS: A total of 5459 minimally-invasive radical prostatectomies, 1740 minimally-invasive radical nephrectomies and 786 minimally-invasive partial nephrectomies were performed during the study period, for which data on resident surgeon involvement was available. In multivariable analyses, resident involvement was not associated with increased odds of overall complications, reoperation, or readmission rates for minimally-invasive prostatectomy, radical and partial nephrectomy. However, operative time was prolonged when residents were involved irrespective of the type of procedure. Length-of-stay was decreased with senior resident involvement in minimally-invasive partial nephrectomies (odds ratio [OR] 0.49, p = 0.04) and prostatectomies (OR 0.68, p = 0.01). The major limitations of this study include its retrospective observational design, inability to adjust for the case complexity and surgeon/hospital characteristics, and the lack of information regarding the minimally-invasive approach utilized (whether robotic or laparoscopic). CONCLUSIONS: Resident involvement is associated with increased operative time in minimally-invasive urologic oncology procedures.

While several studies have concluded that this technique is safe when performed by experienced surgeons under controlled conditions, there are no studies evaluating the learning curve for incorporating SILC into resident education and the effect on OR efficiency. Methods: Clinical chief residents (PGY V) were evaluated from June 2009 through August 2010 by a single attending surgeon facile using SILC techniques. Similar to standard surgical education, residents were transitioned from assistants during their first three SILCs to primary surgeon for the remainder of their experience during their 8 week rotation. Demographics and patient outcome data were recorded in a prospective database for each resident. This was compared to data from standard laparoscopic cholecystectomies and attending surgeon outcomes. Results: 7 PGY V residents were evaluated over the time period. A total of 49 SILCs were performed (mean number of procedures performed: 7; range: 5-12). 4 conversions to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy occurred, all within the first 3 SILCs performed by the resident as operative surgeon. Reasons for conversion included: 2 poor exposure, 1 bleeding, 1 concern for bowel injury. No conversions to open cholecystectomy occurred. Mean blood loss was 25 mL, and mean length of stay was< day. Average length of operation when the attending was the operative surgeon was 63 minutes. There was an increase in operative time to 75 minutes between the second and third cases performed, reflecting the transition of the attending surgeon from primary surgeon to teaching surgeon role. Operative times returned to those of standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy and attending-performed SILCs by resident case number 5. This was maintained until the end of each resident's rotation. Factors associated with longer length of surgery were: increasing BMI and presence of acute or chronic cholecystitis. Postoperative complications were uncommon (1 wound infection, 1 urinary retention, 1 incisional hernia) and were not associated with early or late cases along the learning curve. Conclusion: Residents can safely be taught the techniques of SILC with minimal disruption to operating room efficiency. Residents already proficient in the use of standard laparoscopic techniques transition to SILC quickly with minimal learning curve with proper instruction and supervision. SILC can be incorporated into resident education, but whether incorporating single incision laparoscopic techniques into surgical education is superior to dedicated emersion courses for teaching SILC is yet to be determined.","L70470248     2011-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Whether in an academic or community setting, teaching is essential key component of the profession. No study has compared clinical teaching effectiveness of residents who plan to go into academics with those who plan to work in the community. Objectives: To determine if residents who are academic bound are more effective teachers than community bound residents. Methods: Senior medical students evaluated their resident teachers after each shift in 17 categories on a 5 point Likert scale. Evaluations were compared between residents who self-identified as going into academics vs. those going into community practice. Secondary outcomes looked at the effectiveness of residents who participated in an optional academic teaching track compared to those who did not and effectiveness between chief residents and other residents. P-values were calculated for each outcome using a mixed effect linear regression model. Results: A total of 577 evaluations were completed. There was no statistical significance in any of the 17 categories between those residents who were academic bound versus those who were going into community practice.

Conclusion: This study finds no significant difference in teaching effectiveness between those residents who identify themselves as academic bound compared to those who are community bound, suggesting that teaching ability does not influence a resident's decision to pursue an academic or community career. Academic departments should target excellent resident educators to avoid losing them to community practice.

The American College of Surgeons (ACS) Division of Education partnered with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to convene a National Invitational Conference to define key issues relating to the transition to practice and develop recommendations to address various challenges. OUTCOMES OF THE NATIONAL INVITATIONAL CONFERENCE: Leaders from ACS, ACGME, certifying boards, residency review committees, program director organizations, and professional societies representing the breadth of surgical specialties, along with other key stakeholders, were invited to participate in the 1.5-day conference in July 2012. Key recommendations generated during the conference included the need to focus on the transition to practice within the context of the continuum of professional development; definition of specific levels of knowledge and skills expected of graduating surgery residents; development and adoption of competency-based methods for training, assessment, and advancement of residents; implementation of special interventions during the chief resident year to prepare residents for practice; robust evaluations of residents before graduation; intake assessments of junior surgeons during the onboarding processes; and effective mentorship for junior surgeons as they enter practice. Recommendations also highlighted major regulatory, legal, and financial issues. The key role of ACS and other national organizations in implementing the recommendations was underscored. CONCLUSION: The recommendations from the conference should be of great help in addressing various challenges associated with the transition from surgery residency to independent practice.","Sachdeva, Ajit K     Flynn, Timothy C     Brigham, Timothy P     Dacey, Ralph G Jr     Napolitano, Lena M     Bass, Barbara L     Philibert, Ingrid     Blair, Patrice Gabler     Lupi, Linda K     (ACS)     (ACGME)     eng     Consensus Development Conference     Practice Guideline     Surgery. 2014 May;155(5):867-82. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2013.12.027.

ACGME requirements for graduating general surgery residents are 4 liver and 3 pancreas cases. We sought to evaluate trends in resident experience and autonomy for complex hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgery over time. Methods: We queried the ACGME General Surgery Case Log (2003-2012) for all cases performed by graduating chief residents (GCR) relating to liver, pancreas, and the biliary tract (HPB); simple cholecystectomy was excluded. Mean (6standard deviation), median [10th:90th percentiles] and maximum case volumes were compared from 2003 to 2012. R2 was calculated for all trends. Results: A total of 253,148 complex HPB cases (36% liver, 43% pancreas, 21% biliary) were performed by 10,288 GCRs over the 10-year period examined (Mean = 24.6 per GCR). Of these, 57% were performed during the chief year, while 43% were done as post-graduate year (PGY) 1-4. Only 52% of liver cases were anatomic resections, while 71% of pancreas cases were major resections. Total number of cases increased from 22,516 (Mean = 23.0) in 2003 to 27,191(Mean = 24.9) in 2012. Over this same time period, the percentage of HPB cases that were performed during the chief year decreased by 7% (Liver: 13%, Pancreas 8%, Biliary 4%). There was an increasing trend in the mean number of operations logged by GCRs on the pancreas (9.165.9 to 11.364.3; R2=.85) and liver (8.065.9 to 9.463.4; R2=.91), while those for the biliary tract decreased (5.962.5 to 3.862.1; R2=.96). While the median number of cases increased slightly for both pancreas (7.0 [4.0:15] to 8.0 [4:20]) and liver (7.0 [4:13] to 8.0 [5:14]), the maximum number of cases preformed by any given GCR remained stable for pancreas (51 to 53; R2=.18), but increased for liver (38 to 45; R2=.32). The median number of HPB cases that GCR's performed as teaching assistants (TA) remained at zero over this time period. The 90th percentile of cases performed as TA dropped from 2 to 1 for both pancreas and liver. Conclusions: Roughly one-half of GCR have performed fewer than 10 cases in each of the liver, pancreas or biliary categories at time of completion of residency. While the mean number of complex liver and pancreatic operations performed by GCR increased slightly, the median number remained low and the number of TA cases was virtually zero. Most GCR are unlikely to be prepared to perform complex HPB operations.","L71304306     2014-01-31 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The goal of this study is to evaluate residents' knowledge, learner attitudes, and satisfaction attained from current residency training programs with regard to the healthcare of LGBTQ+ youth. The information gathered from this study will be used to plan specific educational interventions that will close any education gaps discovered. Methods: An anonymous and voluntary survey platform (Qualtrics) was used to assess residents' perceptions of knowledge, level of skill, learner attitudes, and existing learning opportunities related to LGBTQ+ health. This survey has so far been sent via chief residents to the pediatric and psychiatric residents at University of Florida Health in Jacksonville, Florida. The study is still in process, with plans to disseminate the survey to other residency programs across the country. Results: To date, a total of 27 residents have completed the survey; 30 percent of respondents were postgraduate year (PGY)-1, 48 percent PGY-2, 15 percent PGY-3, and seven percent PGY-4. Of these 27 respondents, there were 20 (74%) pediatric residents, six (22%) psychiatric residents, and 1 (4%) medicine and pediatrics resident. Almost all residents agreed that it is important to know a patient's sexual orientation and gender identity and indicated that unique discrepancies exist with regard to LGBTQ+ youth healthcare. For the most part, however, residents reported minimal training, knowledge, and confidence when it came to providing care to this specific population regardless of training level. Residents as a whole are not familiar with national resources for LGBTQ+ youth and their parents, where 63 percent of residents were not aware of any resources and 78 percent had never recommended resources to patients. However, there is a change noted in some aspects of participants' attitudes toward providing LGBTQ care between PGY-1 residents and their more senior counterparts (PGY-2 to PGY-4) Conclusions: The vast majority of residents do not believe that they are adequately educated on LGBTQ+ youth health but feel it is important to learn these skills as part of their training. Therefore, there is a clear need for the development of a standardized model on LGBTQ+ youth healthcare; thus, specific interventions will be developed for residency training program curricula based on residents' perceived needs.","L620079582     2018-01-09 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

K. and Sharp, M. and Carlos, W. G.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000400372507399,English,,,"RATIONALE: It is important for teaching physicians to know what qualities are most valued by learners. To date, only two studies have been published addressing internal medicine residents' perceptions of teaching faculty [1,2]. We sought to expand on the evidence about this topic through a multicenter study at four geographically diverse academic medical centers. Our study focused on teaching characteristics of intensive care unit (ICU) physicians that learners perceive are most impactful. METHODS: The study was conducted at Indiana University, Johns Hopkins University, UCSF, and University of Washington. Internal medicine residents completed an anonymous online survey rating the importance of characteristics of ICU attending role models. Questions on our 37-item-questionnaire were derived from prior studies and from the Stanford Faculty Development Center for Medical Teachers Clinician Teaching program [1,2,3]. Learners also named impactful role models at their institutions. T-tests were used to compare scores. RESULTS: 260 residents responded to the survey. The attributes most commonly rated as very important to trainees were that the attending enjoyed teaching house staff, demonstrated empathy and compassion to patients and families, explained clinical reasoning & differential diagnoses, treated non-MD staff members respectfully, and showed enthusiasm on rounds. Factors that trainees rated as less important were having numerous research publications, having served as a chief resident, sharing personal life with house staff, and organizing end-of-rotation social events. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new information to teaching faculty striving to impact their learners' education. While prior data demonstrated that learners valued attendings having served as a chief resident and sharing personal information with house staff, our study did not replicate this. We confirmed that learners appreciated teachers who are perceived to enjoy teaching. We also discovered that expression of empathy, explanation of clinical reasoning, and qualities of professionalism were influential. Table 1 shows the contrast between our study and the prior literature. This may reflect a new generation of learners, differences between ICU versus ward teaching, or institutional variations. Next steps include analyzing course evaluations of named attending role models and conducting thematic analysis to identify predictors of teaching excellence.","Et6ak     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:3 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

A.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000358386902129,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: In internal medicine residencies, the leap fromintern year to second year represents a dramatic shift of responsibilities from data-gatherer to team leader and educator. Most residencies have little formal training on this transition and even less direct observation of team leadership skills by new senior residents. The objective of this project was to use a structured tool to enable chief residents to directly observe and evaluate new senior residents on their rounds leadership and education skills: the Rounds Leadership Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The intervention took place at 3 hospitals across our internal medicine residency program. Participants were new second-year internal medicine residents. Six chief residents shadowed 50 new second-year internal medicine residents on rounds on an inpatient wards day. DESCRIPTION: We developed a 10-item structured observational assessment to evaluate senior resident leadership behaviors during inpatient morning rounds. Morning rounds involved one senior resident, two interns, one attending physician, and third and fourth year medical students rounding on their list of patients. Items in the observation were chosen based on behaviors that mapped to an entrustment score for an ACGME milestone and/or represented an institution-specific goal for senior wards residents. Each item was quantitatively scored on a Likert-type scale with qualitative examples and feedback also noted for each. Items evaluated were: 1. Showed enthusiasm for the topic and/or the learner, 2. Showed interest through body language, 3. Created a conducive physical environment for learners, 4.Used learners' names, 5. Set an agenda and managed rounds efficiently, 6. Gave positive and corrective feedback to team members, 7. Made clear and salient teaching points during rounds, 8. Demonstrated empathy and compassion with patients and families, 9. Ensured effective communication with team members regarding patient action plans for the day, and 10. Works effectively with the attending physician (e.g. manages up when needed). Chief residents shadowed medical teams, completing the assessment over a 1-2 h period with the team. Each senior resident then received reinforcing and corrective feedback in a 1-h one-on-one debriefing with their chief resident observer. EVALUATION: Throughout the year, we continually reassessed the evaluation metrics and sought feedback on which metrics best captured rounds leadership and education skills. Resident satisfaction with the Rounds Leadership EPA was unanimous with 100 % of residents finding the structured observation and feedback/debriefing sessions useful. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: This novel tool enabled near-peer chief residents to provide direct observation, feedback, and debriefing with new internal medicine senior residents on aspects of rounds leadership and teaching. The structured tool not only allowed objective benchmarking data of specific behaviors that promote leadership & education, but also allowed opportunity for free-form reinforcing and corrective feedback on these behaviors. Moreover, the feedback and debriefing sessions also offered additional opportunities to check in and discuss intangible factors such as resident-attending dynamics, team well-being, and specific teaching strategies. Implementation of the Rounds Leadership EPA also provided a novel method of assessment that directly maps to the ACGME milestones.","Suppl. 2     Cn4fv     2199482     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Despite the growing political and educational interest in disaster medicine, it is unclear if resident training has been able to include these educational goals. While there has been data published on the status of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) education in residencies in the United States (US), no data specifically addresses education in disaster medicine. Recent data indicates disaster-preparedness is the most frequently listed component program directors want to add to their curricula. Additionally, there are no clear standardized recommendations or requirements for training programs. This study surveys residencies in the US to clarify the level of education in disaster medicine in EM residencies specifically, identify areas least and most addressed and highlight effective educational models already in place. Methods: The authors distributed an online survey tool of multiple-choice and free-response questions to accredited EM residency Program Directors and Chief Residents in the US between February 7, 2014 and April 24, 2014. Questions assessed residency background and details on disaster medicine competencies addressed during training. Results: Out of 183 programs, 64 (35%) responded to the survey and completed all required questions. Of the completed surveys, 68.75% of the respondents are program directors and 31.25% are chief residents. Of the respondents, 76.56% represent 3-year training programs and 20.31% are from 4-year programs. 7.41% of the responding programs note they have an associated disaster medicine fellowship. Almost all programs (95.31%) report having some level of disaster medicine training in their residency, but only 26.42% have a specific track or specialty course. The most common disaster medicine educational competencies taught are patient triage and decontamination, both of which are addressed by 78.1% of responding programs. The most commonly identified methods to teach disaster medicine are drills and lectures/ seminars. Program directors report the time spent on disaster medicine training is too little as per 53.70% of respondents, just right as per 42.59% of respondents and too much as per 3.70% of respondents. Commonly identified limitations to providing disaster education are limited time (33.8%) and limited resources (15.4%), though many programs (48.4%) indicate they are not limited in the amount of education they provide. There are no statistically significant differences between 3-and 4-year programs in level of disaster education provided. Conclusion: There are a variety of educational tools used to teach disaster medicine in US residencies today, with a larger focus on the use of lectures and hospital drills. However, there is no indication there is a similar educational approach across all residencies. The better training and background emergency medicine-trained physicians have, the higher chance of success of an emergency department, hospital and community when faced with any level of disaster. This survey highlights the opportunity for the creation of a model for resident education in disaster medicine.","L71668053     2014-11-07 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Our session is set in the ambulatory clinic location for residents. We recently expanded our reach to include inpatient teams through the use of Smart Boards. DESCRIPTION: Each month, our ambulatory clinic hosts a journal club titled Rapid Fire Tasty Morsels. The session occurs from 12-1pm on the final Friday of each block. The leaders of each session include our outpatient evidenced based medicine (EBM) team lead physician and a chief resident. Each session begins with three separate 6-7 min presentations by residents. Each resident is provided with an article that was published in the prior month. We send the article to the residents 1 week prior to our sessions and ask themto have an accompanying power point presentation. Articles are chosen due to their high impact on the medical literature. The next section is titled Icing on the Cake. During this section, the ambulatory EBM lead physician and chief resident have 1 min each to summarize articles in a rapid fire exchange. There are typically 6-8 articles reviewed. Every few sessions, a section titled Icing on Speed is included. During this section, the titles of the articles included in American College of Phyisicians journal club are read, and a 1 line take away point is included. This section is followed by Whipped Cream, which lists the titles of the articles recently published in 2-4 major journals. The final section highlights images that have been published. We often incorporate next step questions, multiple choice questions, or image interpretation for the participants. Each session typically lasts 45-50min, and residents are provided a handout with a summary of the articles from Icing on the Cake and those presented by residents, as well as a list of the articles included in Whipped Cream.

We surveyed all chief residents who finished in the past 10 years, comparing the 5 years before the linking of trauma and critical care to the period since. Between 1982 and 1987, 3 of the 45 finishing residents (7%) pursued trauma fellowships, then trauma care as a career. Since 1987, 12 finishing residents (30% of the total and 33% of those pursuing fellowship training) trained in trauma/critical care. Nine currently pursue trauma care as a career. Two others are academic trauma surgeons without fellowship training and one other practices general surgery with trauma care as a main focus. Thus 12 of the 41 residents (30%) practice trauma care and 14 residents (34%) practice critical care. Residents finishing since 1987 were significantly more likely to respond that they are interested in trauma care, feel trauma care was attractive, and wish to have trauma care be a major portion of their careers. Those who chose not to pursue trauma care cited reasons similar to those described by Richardson and Miller. Other specialty interests were the most important factor in both time periods. Residents finishing after 1987 described the link between trauma care and critical care with a designated ICU service as strong positive influences. The understanding of resuscitation physiology gained in the ICU, including nonsurgical therapy, was felt to enhance trauma care, making it more attractive. In our system, trauma/critical care attending physicians were perceived as important role models. Critical care training enhances the trauma care experience. It is an important educational tool and makes trauma care more attractive as a career.","Ng222     Times Cited:16     Cited References Count:14 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

We previously demonstrated that only 25% of surgeons could correctly identify a written description of the CVS and that 21% could not identify an operative photograph of the CVS. The aim of this study was to evaluate achievement of the CVS in available online videos of LC. Methods Videos of LC published from 2008-2016 were identified via Google, Youtube, SAGES TV, Websurg and C-surgery searches. The videos were reviewed independently by four surgeons (3 attendings, one chief resident) who judged the CVS using the scoring system described by Strasberg for doublet photography. Public versus academic websites, single vs. multisite access, presence of acute cholecystitis, and principle angles for exposure were noted. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v. 23.0, Chicago, IL. Results 73 videos were identified, with 41 from public and 32 from academic websites. There was good correlation between reviewers (Pearson coefficients 0.7-0.8). A satisfactory score for the CVS (5 or 6) was achieved in 62 of 292 (24%) video reviews. There were significant differences in demonstration of the CVS between: public vs. academic websites (16% vs. 33%, p=0.001), single site vs. multisite access (11% vs. 28%, p=0.004), and acute vs. non-acute cholecystitis (13% vs. 26%, p =0.047). Videos that demonstrated both anterior (ventral) and posterior (dorsal) dissection of the hepatocystic triangle attained the critical view more frequently (45%) than those with only anterior (13%) or caudal (3%) exposure, p=0.0001. The single CVS criterion that was least often fulfilled was dissection of the cystic plate. Conclusion The majority of LC videos available online do not satisfactorily achieve the CVS. While videos from academic websites perform better than public websites, two out of three are still unsatisfactory. Combined ventral and dorsal exposure of the hepatocystic triangle is advocated. If the CVS is to be understood and practiced, it must be properly demonstrated by video resources.","Suppl. 1     Ex3ny     1021     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The RightCare Educator program offers grants to chief residents to develop educational initiatives for residents on mindful care. Using this grant, we created a week-long RightCare program for Internal Medicine residents aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge of medical overuse. METHODS: At an academic Internal Medicine program with two primary training sites, multiple study interventions were utilized. An initial presentation introduced basic concepts and definitions of RightCare. Further interventions included an overuse count, Do No Harm report, daily emails, clinical vignette contest and reception with gift card incentives for participation. Knowledge and awareness of overuse/costs were assessed with a survey before and after the intervention using multiple choice questions and Likert scale questions with anchors 1 = never- 6 = always. Analysis included descriptive and univariate analysis with 2- tailed tests with significance at p < 0. 05. Ward residents were analyzed separately. RESULTS: 8/8 (100 %) teams at hospital one and 3/9 (33%) teams at hospital two participated in the overuse count with 24 and 12 counts submitted respectively. Nineteen clinical vignettes were submitted across the two hospitals. For both overall and ward-only analysis, a statistically significant difference in correct answers to 1/3 knowledge questions was seen. No statistically significant difference was seen in the awareness assessment questions. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of our study was to educate residents on proper utilization of care. In both pre and post surveys, the preponderance of answers showed greater than occasional consideration of cost to both patient and healthcare system in resident decision-making. This shows that residents already had some awareness of RightCare and a 1 week introductory initiative alone is insufficient to influence resident practice significantly. Additionally, residents responded that there was rarely discussion of costs with attending staff, both pre and post-intervention. Taking both of these ideas together, we feel that a cultural shift toward mindful care is necessary. Future plans include continued discussion of RightCare during daily didactics and through residency social media with a follow-up awareness survey.","Suppl. 2     Ei0yl     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

ABIM also recommends initial training in these procedures be simulation-based, but there is wide variability in existing curriculum from didactics to the classic see one, do one, teach one. Bedside ultrasonography is a burgeoning field within internal medicine residency programs as studies show improved procedure success with decreased procedure-associated complications. Despite this, no literature exists describing the implementation or impact of an internal medicine resident run ultrasound-based procedure service. Purpose: To design, create and implement an internal medicine rotation to teach a standardized curriculum in ABIM essential procedures using ultrasound guidance. Description: At our institution, prior procedure curriculum consisted of simulationbased training with procedure expertise obtained using the see one, do one, teach one method. This introduced significant variability in the technique, success rate and complication rate, as residents were taught by different supervisors each month. This inconsistency, along with emerging evidence in support of bedside ultrasonography, provided the impetus for the creation of an ultrasoundbased procedure service. The procedure service is a onemonth- long rotation during the intern year, with a team consisting of 2 interns and a chief resident. The curriculum begins with pre-testing of intern knowledge, introduction to the ultrasound, didactics on the indications, contraindications, risks, benefits of all procedures, instruction on appropriate consenting, viewing of online procedure (Table presented) videos, and simulation training with LP, CVC, thoracentesis, paracentesis task trainers. After this introduction, we practice visualization of normal organs, cavities and vessels on patient volunteers followed by standardized handson teaching of procedures. Table 1 outlines the data collected as of Dec. 1, 2011. These data show 100% success rate for thoracentesis and paracentesis. More importantly, 85 consults did not have procedures performed either because there was not enough fluid or a contraindication existed (DIC, anticoagulation prior to LP, hypotensive, severe anemia), thus preventing unnecessary and potentially harmful procedures. In order to demonstrate competency, interns must take a post-test on procedure knowledge, pass several competency checklists illustrating proficiency and safety and be deemed competent by the chief resident. Conclusions: The introduction of an ultrasound-based procedure rotation provides a standardized curriculum for interns with improved procedure success and a decrease in unnecessary and potentially harmful procedures.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Hosp Med. 2012 Mar;7 Suppl 2:S1-S323. doi: 10.1002/jhm.1927.

With a combination of formal and self-directed training, all senior residents in our program passed FLS. After testing is completed, it is critical that surgical residents retain the skills examined in FLS. Unfortunately, skill retention is suspect. This study assesses retention of the most challenging FLS skill, intra-corporeal knot tying (IKT). Methods: Eight months after FLS testing, residents were surveyed and tested in IKT. To test true retention, residents were not forewarned of the study. Each resident provided the number of times he or she practiced IKT prior to FLS testing, participated in IKT skills labs, and performed IKT in the operating room (OR). Each resident rated his or her IKT confidence level on a 5 point scale from very confident to little confidence. The resident operative log database was queried for the number of basic and complex laparoscopic cases performed by each resident during the interval from the FLS testing date to the study date. Finally, each resident was timed on IKT (in seconds). Accuracy was assessed by subtracting the total deviation from the black dots on the Penrose (in mm). Results: Seven of eight chief residents completed the study (table). Mean values are provided (table presented). Analysis of covariance showed no interaction with exposure and IKT time or accuracy. No correlation was shown between IKT time and the variables. However, IKT accuracy strongly correlated with IKT skills labs attended (? = 0.797, p = 0.032) and basic laparoscopic cases logged (? = 0.878, p = 0.009). Conclusions: FLS is the most widely used method of assessing laparoscopic skill competency. With practice, senior level surgical residents can reach expert level for these five tasks. Despite formal curricula and increasing laparoscopy fellowship-trained educators, resident technical skill retention is marginal. Five of seven residents failed to complete IKT in a timely manner. However, IKT accuracy demonstrated more staying power. Attending skill lab sessions and participating in basic laparoscopic cases that truly allow a resident to do the case increased IKT accuracy. It is clear that more experience than is currently provided is necessary to retain FLS skills. If experience can't be obtained in the OR, skills lab attendance should be mandatory.","L71511633     2014-07-01 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

PSH has recently been implemented at our institution for Urology patients. We desired to compare length of stay in these patients before, during, and after PSH implementation. METHODS: A before and after comparison of length of stay in all patients scheduled for cystectomies, partial nephrectomies, radical nephrectomies, and prostatectomies was examined. Pre-PSH (1/2014 to 10/2014): Patients were evaluated in the Pre-Anesthesia Consultation and Education (PACE) clinic prior to surgery, with perioperative care managed by individual practitioners. Postoperative care was managed by the surgical team. PSH patients (1/2015 to 10/2015): Patients were also evaluated in the PACE clinic prior to surgery, with optimization prior to surgery directed by the PSH Anesthesiologist. Postoperative care plans were discussed and patients were educated regarding expected recovery milestones, pain control, and discharge plans. Intraoperative care was provided by anesthesia teams of Anesthesiologists supervising residents or CRNAs. Patient specific care plans were communicated emphasizing desired intraoperative management goals. Post-operative care was provided by the PSH team: PSH Anesthesiologist, Urology Chief Residents, a nurse practitioner, and an anesthesia resident. This team addressed co-morbidities, pain management, nutrition, ileus, and discharge planning. The patients were divided into pre-PSH (baseline) and PSH groups. The primary outcome measure was postoperative length of stay (LOS). The PSH group was further divided into Transition (1/2015 through 5/2015) and PSH (6/2015 through 10/2015) patients to compare transitional LOS. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics (Fig 1). LOS was overall significantly shorter in PSH (Fig 2). Evaluation of LOS in each type of surgery showed a significant difference in LOS for cystectomies but not in other surgeries (Fig 3). Incremental improvements made to PSH were associated with greater decreases in LOS in PSH compared to pre- PSH and transitional patients (Fig 4). CONCLUSION: PSH is an opportunity to improve healthcare and better serve patients. We found an overall LOS decrease, with differences between types of surgeries. While LOS was shorter in PSH cystectomy patients, LOS following partial and radical nephrectomies was shorter in PSH but did not reach significance; a larger sample size may show significance. It may be difficult to show decreased LOS after prostatectomy surgery, as LOS is short with minimal room for improvement. However, implementing change can be challenging. Our findings support ongoing process improvement results in additional decrease in LOS. While early outcomes support PSH as a qualitybased implementation to decrease LOS, this study demonstrates that the resulting decrease in LOS may take time to achieve. With an anesthesiologist led PSH, decreased LOS can lead to reduced costs while simultaneously increasing healthcare value.

Therefore, we aimed to identify extents of deficiency in functional urology education, and to develop an infrastructure that incorporates learning material, tools, and facilities into a uniform educational system. STUDY DESIGN, MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of a functional urology education assessment of 18 chief urology residents from eight different Canadian training institutions. The data was collected during a comprehensive two-day functional urology course designed for Canadian chief urology residents. Residents answered a basic questionnaire immediately prior to a pre-course assessment exam, in which they evaluated their competency (self-evaluation of competency to manage independently patients with voiding dysfunction), certainty (overall self-perceived confidence level upon managing patients with voiding dysfunction) and satisfaction (satisfaction level with regard to the overall effectiveness/quality of functional urology teaching during residency) in this urology subspecialty. Their performance in functional urology was assessed with a comprehensive written exam of short answers and multiple-choice questions, before and after the course completion, intended to be comparable to the format of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada urology examination. RESULTS: Overall, residents (n=18) achieved significantly higher post-course total score (78.6 % post course versus 55.4% pre-course, P =0.001), with an estimated mean percentage of change of approximately 44%. Based on a 5-point Likert scale (1 to 5), the self-reported mean results were for competency 3.11 (±0.676), overall certainty 3.55 (±0.783), and satisfaction score 3.16 (± 0.707). Overall competency and satisfaction level significantly correlated with pre-course scores (P<0.05). Eleven participants (60%) reported that they need more training, and 7 (30%) reportedan insufficient number of cases or not enough time. Most of the participants (67%) reported problem-based learning as the most preferred teaching method, while 28% preferred real patient practical sessions. 13 residents (72%) confirmed that adding more dedicated training sessions within curriculum and extra courses as the most helpful suggestion to improve their competency level. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: The significant correlation of pre-course scores with competency and satisfaction level among functional urology knowledge and clinical application indicates a gap in resident's experience in functional urology. The higher post-course test score is reflective of the level of competency of chief residents, and the improvement achieved with a 2-day focused course. Despite the development of minimum education standards for urology training, it is unclear whether residents are graduating with the essential skill set particularly for this filed of urology. CONCLUDING MESSAGE: Institutions need to offer consistent and uniform post-graduate training across all urology sub-specialties to ensure adequate skill acquisition by their final year. These findings highlight the need to integrate more interactive problem-based training sessions and extra-curricular teaching tools into functional urology training curriculum. This may consolidate learner engagement and improve training effectiveness and continuity of care.","Suppl. 5     Gl9wj     249     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

With similar rates of chronic illness and higher rates of mental illness and substance abuse than community-dwelling adults, former prisoners' health is at risk due to gaps in their care from lack of insurance, lack of access, and difficulty with readjustment to society. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: To establish a clinic for recently incarcerated adults providing: (a) access to primary care and specialty services including psychiatry, social services and substance abuse care, (b) assistance establishing insurance coverage, and (c) assistance obtaining medications. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: To engage patients in primary care by partnership with community-based organizations and a community health worker (CHW). LEARNING OBJECTIVE 3: none. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION: We established a Transitions Clinic for recently incarcerated adults through partnership with two organizations that have regular contact with this population. The Bronx Parole and Reentry Committee and The Osborne Association, a local prisoner advocacy organization, both welcomed the collaboration to access primary care for their clients. Initially, appointments were scheduled through personal communication between the community organizations, a chief resident and the clinic director. With recently secured funding, a community health worker will assist with patient recruitment and scheduling using a dedicated cellular phone. The clinic is held each Saturday morning in a South Bronx Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). Attending physicians from the FQHC volunteer to provide patient care. Nursing and administrative staff are already present for existing Saturday clinical sessions. A four hour block of time is reserved each week for initial visits. Thereafter, patients follow up during regularly scheduled clinical sessions with the same physician seen at the initial visit. Providers use the FQHC's resources, including social work, mental health and substance abuse services. Uninsured patients access all services, including laboratory testing, specialty care, and medications, through the FQHC's standard sliding scale fee scheme. FINDINGS TO DATE: Since July, 2009, the clinic has seen 41 patients during 18 sessions. A total of 59 patients have been scheduled with a no show rate of 30%. Though initially conceived as a drop-in clinic, most patients have had scheduled appointments. Thirty-eight patients were referred from the parole office, and three from the Osborne Association. Thirteen patients had Medicaid coverage at initial visit, and 28 (68%) lacked coverage. The clinic has seen one woman and 40 men with various medical conditions including Hepatitis C infection (12%), diabetes (7%), hypertension (14%), and asthma (17%). A total of 74 prescriptions were written for the 41 patients with an average of 1.8 per patient (range 0-12). KEY LESSONS LEARNED: We have demonstrated the feasibility of working with both community-based and corrections-based organizations to increase access for the recently incarcerated. We have learned that patients scheduled by a parole office will often keep appointments, but may be a healthier cohort than we initially expected, as evidenced by the relatively low rates of chronic disease and the low number of prescriptions written per patient. We have shown that funding and viable candidates for community health workers are available in the community, but have not yet seen the impact of integrating a CHW into the clinic.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Gen Intern Med. 2010 Jun;25 Suppl 3:S205-567. doi: 10.1007/s11606-010-1338-5.

Despite the high burden of musculoskeletal disorders, physicians are often underprepared to manage such disorders due to inadequate training during medical school and residency. We present here a novel experiential curriculum to teach internal medicine residents the evaluation and management of joint specific disorders using a multi-station objective structured clinical exam model (OSCE). The objectives were to improve trainee knowledge of and confidence in the musculoskeletal exam for a range of conditions common to primary care practice. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one of forty-six residents from Yale's Primary Care Internal Medicine Program rotated over a period of 6 months through the musculoskeletal curriculum during their ambulatory blocks. Participants included all 3 years of residency training. Eleven Yale Medical Student volunteers who had received 45 min of training served as standardized patients. Two chief residents and nine clinical faculty served as evaluators and instructors at each OSCE station. DESCRIPTION: Three musculoskeletal teaching workshops (Neck Pain, Back Pain and Knee Pain) were created. Each workshop was preceded by a 1 h lecture which reviewed relevant anatomy, history, exam findings, work up and treatment. The workshops themselves consisted of three to four case-based OSCE's through which residents rotated over a 90 min period. Residents were evaluated on exam technique, assessment and treatment plan and received feedback from faculty instructors and medical student standardized patients. EVALUATION: Outcomes assessed in this study include: formative assessment of the individual residents by faculty instructors; perceived educational value of the curriculum as assessed by anonymous surveys of participating faculty, residents, and students; and efficacy of the educational intervention as assessed by a formal post-workshop OSCE exam and a confidence and knowledge based questionnaire. As half the residency program had yet to participate in their ambulatory block OSCE, we are able to compare participants of the curriculum to internal controls using a retrospective cohort analysis. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: Whereas previous studies have utilized OSCE's to evaluate resident medical knowledge, this curriculum aims to utilize the OSCE itself as a standardized teaching tool. Preliminary data suggests improved disease specific knowledge, as well as improved confidence and competence in the musculoskeletal exam among participating trainees. Furthermore, both resident and student participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the curriculum. Importantly, our curriculum involves learners across several levels of medical training including medical students, residents, and faculty, thus meeting both undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education needs. The voluntary and enthusiastic participation of medical students in our study suggests a cost-effective and pragmatic model for combining medical student and resident physical exam education as well as a tool to generate interest in primary care medicine among medical students. We have shown that it is possible to implement an effective OSCE-based musculoskeletal exam curriculum in a medium sized training program. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether this intervention leads to sustained improvements in musculoskeletal exam confidence and competence in the outpatient setting.","Suppl. 1     Ab6zp     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

K. and Starr, R. and Brennan, M.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000333405500712,English,,,"Background: Over half of Internal Medicine (IM) residents' patient encounters are with elders but many programs devote little attention to geri atrics. This reflects time constraints, competing curricular demands, a dearth of geriatricians and perhaps unspoken biases. The authors report a new longitudinal Geriatrics curriculum, Geri-Pearls, which has successfully incorporated geriatrics into the residency's weekly Academic Half Day (AHD) didactics series at Baystate Medical Center. This was facilitated by the presence of an existing residency- based AGS chapter. Methods: Resident members of the Baystate AGS chapter and additional resident volunteers select topics from the upcoming AHD schedule. The residents prepare a brief interactive case and then summarize a few geriatrics teaching pearls for 5-10 minutes. Content is reviewed beforehand with a geriatrician mentor; the residents also practice their presentation skills with IM faculty or a Chief Resident. The learners' knowledge is assessed by pre and post tests and they review assigned readings before and after each session. One geri pre and post question is being added to this evaluation process. Results: The Geri-Pearls initiative has been well received and is a successful example of stealth geriatrics. There is now a drip following the intermittent boluses of dedicated AHD geriatrics sessions to reinforce key themes over time. Baystate's IM residency has a required intern rotation in geriatrics; residents also occasionally assist in outpatient geriatric evaluation clinics. However, other than those who join the local AGS chapter, residents previously have not had any ongoing structured teaching and mentoring in geriatrics. An additional benefit has been the professional development of the resident leaders in the AGS chapter. They have participated in the development of a curricular innovation and have polished their presentation and teaching skills. Conclusion: Innovative means of weaving geriatrics education into IM residency programs are sorely needed. The Geri-Pearls project fosters career development for residents, enhances collaboration between IM and geriatrics faculty and most importantly is improving residents' knowledge and thereby enhancing the care of older adults. Structured evaluation of the long-term impact is needed but this is a potentially efficient, practical and well-accepted method of teaching core geriatrics principles over time.","Suppl. 1 Sp. Iss.

Clinical Pathologic Conference (CPC), a case-based teaching conference, was developed to demonstrate diagnostic reasoning. OBJECTIVE: Create and evaluate a chief resident-run Grand Rounds CPC to model and encourage diagnostic reasoning. METHODS: Following a visiting professorship by a faculty member from an institution with an existing CPC, we formed a CPC taskforce. We outlined key steps in CPC construction. (1) Case criteria: Presented at least 5 years ago; uncommon disease or unusual presentation; encourages differential diagnoses related to specific findings; test or imaging confirms the diagnosis. (2) Case acquisition: Solicit cases from faculty by providing criteria and select based on best fit. (3) Case writing: Condense case into 1-2 pages with history, exam, clinical course, and data to suggest one unifying diagnosis. (4) Vetting: Ask blinded faculty to work through draft and comment on presumed diagnosis, feasibility and learning value; edit or reject case. (5) Chief resident role: Give written case six weeks prior to CPC; faculty mentor assigned to assist chief in making a 45 minute presentation on his/her diagnostic reasoning process and conclusions. (6) Specialist role: Recruited to discuss the test or finding confirming the diagnosis. (7) Institutional engagement: Promote the event to faculty and learners; remind specific faculty; evaluate sessions for future improvement. RESULTS: Attendance at Grand Rounds was 28% higher for CPCs. Evaluations revealed enthusiasm for the format, requests for more CPCs, and appreciation for exploring diagnostic reasoning. Participants agreed they could use the CPC as a platform to discuss diagnostic thinking in difficult cases (N=42, 29% met expectation, 71% exceeded expectation). CONCLUSIONS: We created a CPC program that engaged learners and faculty in the process of diagnostic reasoning.

J. and Ramey, A. and Lyden, E. and Fedderson, J.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000331939302442,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Root-cause analysis (RCA) is a method for investigating and correcting systems defects. While it is expected that residents learn how to recognize and analyze system errors, it can be logistically challenging to teach given competing duty obligations. Although residents are on the front-lines of patient care, they rarely take part in institutional patient safety initiatives. To address these challenges, we developed an interactive case conference (Patient Safety Morning Report) in which learners explored themes of patient safety via a modified-RCA. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patient Safety Morning Report took place at a university-based Internal Medicine residency program. Participants were senior residents, interns, and medical students rotating on the inpatient wards service. DESCRIPTION: Patient Safety Morning Report was developed and moderated by a chief resident and faculty with expertise in patient safety. It was held over three 45 min sessions, during the normal morning report time. After a didactic primer on RCA, a clinical vignette demonstrating an adverse patient outcome was presented. An event flow-diagram was displayed and the group analyzed the case to identify contributing factors. Systems-focused questions were generated and researched independently by participants prior to the next session. During the second session, participants reported their findings which were integrated into a fish-bone diagram. During the third session, participants created causal statements and solutions to address the root-causes of error. EVALUATION: Participants' attitudes and knowledge relating to patient safety and RCA were tested pre- and post-intervention. Thirty-five learners attended at least one of the three conferences, and twenty-two (10 students and 12 residents) took both pre- and post-tests (63 %). There was significant improvement in the median Likert score for three of ten attitudebased questions related to blame, the RCA process, and identification of systems-level problems. There was significant improvement in three of nine knowledge-based topics, including contributing factors, causal statements, and hierarchy of actions. There was borderline significant improvement (p= 0.0522) in understanding of fishbone diagrams. The median number of correct answers to knowledge based questions increased fromsix to eight (p=<0.001). Scores were similar for residents and students. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Patient Safety Morning Report is an effective strategy for teaching RCA and principles of patient safety. Pilot data indicate that participants find the conference enjoyable, relevant, and sustainable. The current study shows the intervention also improves attitudes and knowledge related to patient safety. By integrating the intervention into the pre-existing morning report schedule, learners did not sacrifice time from other duties. The intervention also served to diversify the morning report experience, while teaching and assessing several important educational outcomes (i.e. Milestones) across multiple Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competency domains. Future areas of interest include making the conference inter-professional. Ultimately, learner-generated solutions will be conveyed to hospital administration, serving as a means by which residents can impact institutional patient safety.","Suppl. 1     Ab6zp     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Work rounds provide house staff with the opportunity to review patients' hospital course, test results, treatment plan, and anticipated length of stay. Skillful execution of this interaction improves patient satisfaction. Similarly, the hospital discharge process is a patient-physician encounter that requires substantial skill. At discharge, house staff must reconcile medications, discuss follow-up tests and appointments, and ask about obstacles to compliance. These tasks are not a part of medical education but are essential to achieving a safe discharge. Purpose: To assess and improve resident competence at essential elements of physician patient communication during work rounds and at discharge through the use of standardized patients (SPs). Description: Using a structured assessment tool, our chief residents performed a needs assessment by directly observing house staff during patient interactions. The analysis revealed substantial need for improvement (Table 1). Given this data we sought to supplement and reinforce patient-centered communication through the development of standardized patient (SP) encounters. We created 4 SP cases in 2 settings: 2 cases were set during work rounds and 2 at discharge. For each of the 2 cases in the same setting, 1 was a more difficult variation of the other. The clinical elements remained the same in both cases, but the patient's cultural background, demeanor, and need for counseling changed. The cases focused on communication areas, such as symptom control, postdischarge follow-up, and anticipatory guidance. For each case a behavioral checklist was created to assess resident performance. Thirty internal medicine residents will experience all 4 cases and receive formative feedback from each SP about their interpersonal skills, their clarity of communication, and the results of their behavioral checklist. The house staff will also participate in a feedback session to determine if they believed the SP encounters reinforced the intended behaviors. To assess whether the SP encounters can identify residents with strong communication skills, resident performance will be compared with data collected during work rounds by the chief residents. Using the resident rounding data and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey data, we will evaluate if there is a change in resident behavior and patient satisfaction after their participation in the standardized patient scenarios. Conclusions: House staff communication skills were observed to be insufficient using a structured assessment tool. Standardized patients may be an effective method to improve resident's communication skills during work rounds and at discharge.","L71753281     2015-02-03 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

This practice provides residents with the opportunity to review with patients the hospital course, results from previously completed tests, changes to the treatment plan, and the anticipated length of stay in the hospital. House staff can also assess a patient's physical discomfort and address any questions. Executing these communication tasks skillfully improves patient satisfaction. Unfortunately, proficiency in patient-centered rounds is not currently emphasized in medical school curricula or residency training. In an effort to overcome this gap in education and improve patient satisfaction, mandatory training and evaluation of physician communication skills have become program requirements. Purpose: We implemented a formal process using observation and feedback of residents during work rounds to evaluate and improve communication skills. Description: In Mount Sinai Hospital's internal medicine residency, resident-led health care teams are required to round on a patient at least once daily. In an effort to assess clinical judgment, communication skills, and teaching ability, the chief residents regularly observe residents and provide feedback on their performance. To standardize the evaluation of the residents, the investigators developed a behavioral checklist - the rounding log - to monitor and evaluate patient centeredness, teaching, and compliance (Table 1). To date, 62 observations for 48 residents have been recorded over a 20-week period. Preliminary results from these observations demonstrate that house staff members have room for improvement on their communication behavior (Table 2). Although most house staffers are friendly and courteous, fewer than half introduce new members of the team to the patients, and fewer than a quarter consistently inquire about patients' pain. In interactions with patients, < 25% always provide anticipatory guidance to their patients, and few residents always actively include the medical students. Although these data demonstrate communication weaknesses, resident performance improved over time: resident observations from weeks 16 to 20 showed improved performance as compared with weeks 1-8. This improvement likely reflects a cultural shift toward greater patient-centeredness.(table present) Conclusions: Internal medicine house staffers at an urban academic hospital have substantial deficits in communication behaviors. A formal and structured observation program during morning rounds can improve resident performance.","L71753280     2015-02-03 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

P.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000310928800092,English,,,"Study Objective: We describe the use of simulation techniques to create a mock deposition that bolstered EM medicolegal curricula. Methods: Several planning meetings were held between the simulation directors, legal/compliance officers for our hospital, and attorneys from the firm that defends our hospital. The agreed-on idea was to develop a medicolegal education day. A real case that was found in the plaintiff's favor was used after altering the case for privacy concerns. A simulated chart was created within our electronic medical record, along with prior visits. A volunteer for the deposed was obtained in the form of a valiant chief resident. A formal notification of deposition was sent to the resident and the entire residency/faculty. The chief resident met with her defense team and prepared for her deposition per normal routine. On the day of the mock deposition, the resident and her counsel gave a brief overview of the preparation by repeating the predeposition meeting in abbreviated form. The resident then had a deposition from defense and plaintiff attorneys (actual JDs). The deposition was videotaped and a video debriefing was conducted and facilitated by the attorneys. After the debriefing, the learners were then given lectures regarding legal topics. The attorneys concluded the day with the review of 4 actual blinded ED charts for documentation and discussion points. A postsimulation survey was sent to learners involved. Results: Instant feedback regarding the simulation was overwhelmingly positive from both residents and faculty. Key learning points were that participating in a deposition is a skill that improves with time and practice. Techniques for dealing with a deposition were discussed by attorneys. Faculty and residents commented that some points emphasized by the attorneys differed from the dogma usually taught by emergency medicine faculty.","035fn     62     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

CHCC is the sole ambulatory site for thirty residents (PGY1-3), one chief resident (PGY4) and 18 attending physicians. CHCC is one of 22 Montefiore Medical Center ambulatory sites and is targeted for inclusion in the institutional effort to obtain PCMH certification. DESCRIPTION: During the academic year 2010-2011 we initiated an iterative educational process to engage residents in a dialogue about SBP. An anonymous web-based survey was sent to all 19 PGY2 and 3 residents asking them how they would handle four common clinical scenarios that occur when the resident is not in clinic or between patients' clinic visits: (1) following up of critical lab values; (2) scheduling non-routine follow-up appointments; (3) handling urgent care situations when patients call from home; and (4) titrating medications. Each scenario was derived from our clinical experience and piloted with colleagues prior to survey distribution. Results were analyzed and a set of best practices was created. At a program-wide retreat attended by approximately 25 residents and faculty we moderated a two-hour discussion on the survey results, best practices and other SBP topics identified. A second anonymous survey was sent to the same 19 residents assessing the value of monthly SBP meetings. NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Although the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires physicians-in-training to achieve proficiency in Systems-based Practice (SBP), one of six domains of physician competency, few effective training methods have been described. The ACGME defines SBP as the ability to identify, evaluate and utilize health care system resources to provide optimal care. SBP is especially important in internal medicine residency programs, where residents have fragmented schedules and competing commitments. The emergence of the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model, with its emphasis on optimizing resources and team based care, presents an opportunity to engage residents in SBP while fulfilling ACGME educational objectives and improving patient care. To this end, we designed and implemented a resident-driven educational program to improve resident competency in SBP, and provide an ongoing forum for discussion, education and innovation at our ambulatory teaching clinic. EVALUATION: Seventy-four percent (14/19) of residents responded to the initial survey, with up to 5 solutions given for each scenario. Responses varied by the skill level of the clinic staff member asked to assist with the task, the number of phone calls, emails, and hand-offs required, and the time needed for task completion. Given the heterogeneity of responses a set of best practices, emphasizing nonphysician resources, was created and disseminated. Our second survey used a 5-point Likert scale (5=Quite Valuable, 1=No Value) to quantify the value of monthly SBP discussions. One hundred percent (14/14) of responders reported that sessions would be valuable or quite valuable. We then initiated monthly discussions (60-75 minutes) during ambulatory blocks (4-8 residents/month). To date we have held two sessions. Prior to each session we solicit SBP topics and distribute a resident derived agenda. Afterwards, we email key takeaway points and post updates on our program's searchable website. DISCUSSION/REFLECTION/LESSONS LEARNED: The development of a resident-driven process to address SBP is feasible, meets ACGME requirements, and provides an opportunity to optimize care at a primary care teaching clinic. Through our program, residents learn about the elements of SBP, collectively evaluate clinic processes, assume a stakeholder role in the functioning of their clinic, and facilitate the improvement of patient care. Our iterative process allows us to craft agendas for monthly SBP meetings based on real-time issues as defined by residents. These have included the making and tracking of timely referrals, incorporating non-MD providers into the management of chronic diseases, planning for the electronic medical record, and effectively managing and communicating with patients between visits. We have found that our residents are invested in SBP and are eager to engage in discussions to evaluate systems and implement change. The process will become increasingly beneficial as our clinic evolves into a certified PCMH.","eng     Congresses     Overall     J Gen Intern Med. 2011 May;26 Suppl 1:S1-620. doi: 10.1007/s11606-011-1730-9.

N. and Hathaway, J. and Choma, N. N. and Peterson, N. B. and Green, J. and Denny, J.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000209142900188,English,,,"BACKGROUND: The most recent regulations regarding resident duty hours became effective in July, 2011 and included restriction of shifts to a maximum of 16 hours for interns in all specialties. There is little objective data regarding the impact of these new duty hour limits on resident education. We hypothesized that the duty hour changes would not have a significant impact on intern educational opportunities. METHODS: Vanderbilt University Medical Center is a large tertiary care hospital in Nashville, TN with 47 interns in 2010 and 50 interns in 2011. We evaluated intern educational experience at our university hospital training site over the first six 4-week blocks of the 2010 and 2011 academic years. All inpatient services went from a 30-hour maximum shift length (2010) to a 16- hour maximum shift length (2011). Using KnowledgeMap Portfolio, a concept-based curriculum management program that captures all traineeauthored notes written in the electronic medical record, we evaluated several objective metrics: number of notes written (history and physical or daily progress note), number of unique patients seen, numbers of five common procedures (arterial line placement, central line placement, thoracentesis, paracentesis, and lumbar puncture), and attendance at two academic conferences. All analyses were limited to inpatient experiences and restricted to intern experiences. We also compared average weekly intern duty hours. RESULTS: When comparing the first six blocks of 2011 to 2010, interns cared for more unique patients (mean 140 vs. 118 patients per intern; p=0.005) and wrote more history and physicals (mean 87 vs. 73; p=0.005). There was no difference in the number of daily progress notes (289 vs. 286, p=0.92) and overall notes (376 vs. 360, p=0.51). There was no difference in the median number of procedures performed (4 vs. 3 per intern p=0.71) or exposure to any individual procedure. Attendance was higher at the weekly noon chief resident conference (68% vs. 60% p<0.0001), but unchanged at morning report conferences (79% vs. 78%, p=0.49). There was no difference in average weekly duty hours per intern (69.4 vs. 68.2 hours/week; p=0.293). CONCLUSIONS: Using four objective metrics of educational opportunities - notes written, unique patients seen, procedures performed, and attendance at academic conferences - we demonstrate that educational opportunities for interns were not decreased after implementation of 16- hour shifts. In fact, our data suggests that interns cared for more unique patients, did more initial patient evaluations (history and physicals), and had higher attendance at a weekly educational conference. It will be important to evaluate the impact of these increased opportunities on medical knowledge and decision-making over the course of residency training. To our knowledge, this is the first study to objectively evaluate the impact of the 16-hour rule change on intern education.","Suppl. 2     V35ig     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Residents without previous experience no longer feel abandoned during the crucial initial weeks. Their close association with their tutors has led to the establishment of a congenial working relationship. The elimination of the chief residency has reduced the problems of pyramidalism and contributed to the emergence of a strong esprit de corps. The reduction in the workload per resident to a very reasonable weekly amount has resulted in a rapid reporting of autopsies and an improvement in their quality. The opportunities for further development for senior residents are increased, since they no longer have to dedicate a considerable part of their residency to menial tasks. The time spent as a chief resident can now be devoted to further specialization or special projects. In summary, the tutor system should fulfill, and perhaps exceed, the requirements for any alternative to the chief residency. The tutor system is completely integrated with the pathology assistant program. Their harmony is insured through their immediate supervision by the pathologist in charge of the autopsy service, as representative of the director of the department of pathology.

M. and Formanek, P. and Conroy, M. E. and Brown, W. and Shanawani, H.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000400372500115,English,,,"Rationale Experts in quality improvement (QI) and pulmonary and critical care medicine have stressed the importance of quality improvement education for trainees in pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM). To that end, physicians entering fellowship would benefit from training in QI and patient safety (PS). This training relies on the availability of expert faculty; however, there is a dearth of such faculty at most PCCM programs. In 2012, the Veterans Administration developed the Chief Residency in Quality and Safety (CRQS) initiative with the specific goal of redesigning medical education and patient care to include the area of quality and patient safety. As of the beginning of AY2017, VA will have 84 CRQS positions at 57 VA Medical Centers. This study reviews those VA medical centers with both a PCCM fellowship and a CRQS program. Methods The authors reviewed The American Medical Association's FREIDA Database and the ACGME public reporting system to identify ACGME-accredited pulmonary and critical care (PCCM) fellowship training programs to identify fellowship programs with a VA facility affiliated with the fellowship. They then compared that list against those VA programs that have a CRQS program in place at that PCCM fellowship's university affiliate. Results Out of 153 ACGME-accredited PCCM fellowship training programs, 88 programs had a VA facility affiliate. Of those 88 VA facilities, 57 VAs have a CRQS training program as of academic year (AY) 2016 and/or projected for AY 2017. Of the 57 CRQS programs, 47 have educational interventions with direct relevance acute care medicine, pulmonary or critical care medicine. Conclusions VA-affiliated programs with a PCCM fellowship have available to them a local expert educator in QI/PS in the CRQS position. Although these Chief Residents are yet early in their training, they spend an entire year focused on the practice and teaching of QI/PS. PCCM programs can reach out to these Chief Residents to provide structured QI/PS education for PCCM fellows, assistance with ongoing improvement projects, curricular support for their fellowship training programs, and opportunities for fellows to take a gap year as chief residents with a focus on quality and safety education and training.","Et6ak     A1114     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

However, the program was cited as not being in compliance in providing a sufficient number of patients to supply inpatient education. The patient experience report for only 8-12 consults per resident in 24 months was deemed as insufficient. Objective: To devise a system which would strengthen the inpatient experience and adequately address the RRC citation. A goal of 5 inpatient consults/month was established as the target goal for the A/I inpatient consult team. This 5 per month goal would result in 30 inpatient consults/fellow over the 24 month training period. Methods: A multi-tiered system was designed to achieve the targeted goal and consisted of the following: 1) A/I fellow input was solicited in addressing a viable plan in addressing the citation, 2) the Chief Residents, Hospitalists and Program Directors of both the Internal Medicine (IM) and Pediatric residency programs were informed of the need for additional inpatient consults, 3) contact numbers of both the IM and Ped hospitalists and resident work rooms were provided to the A/I inpatient team, 4) electronic access to pediatric admission notes was provided to the A/I inpatient team, 5) inclusion in the pediatric email group announcing asthma admissions was arranged, and 6) the development of a new Stello position whereas the 2nd year A/I fellow acted in a supervisory position for the first year A/I inpatient fellow. Outcomes: Passive implementation was started July 2009 with the first 2 months yielding 3 consults/month as the inpatient team waited to be consulted. As this fell short of the goal, the inpatientA/I team took a more proactive approach and regularly queried admissions and contacted the inpatient teams for potential consults. This more proactive approach has since yielded the minimum targeted goal with the inpatient experience report for the 2011 graduating class averaging 37 per resident in 24 months. Conclusion: In response to an RRC citation, an innovative, proactive inpatient paradigm was created which has led to a sustained achievement of targeted inpatient goals. Additionally, RRC core competencies were enhanced in each of the six core competencies enriching the educational value for the A/I fellows' educational experience.","L70579816     2011-11-22 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Methods: Senior residents at a single institution underwent a two-month LCBDE curriculum involving reading and video didactics, and training on a LCBDE-specific simulator using a 'deliberate practice' learning model. Residents completed pre and post-curriculum tests, with the passing score determined using an Angoff method. The curriculum occurred in three phases over three academic years: in the first stage (2012-13) residents were trained individually by a fellow preceptor, in the second (2013-4) residents were paired with an ORnurse and trained as a team, and in the third (2014-15) chief residents who had passed the curriculum during the prior phases served as trainers for additional curriculum-naïve PGY-4 resident andORnurse teams. Clinical volume of LCBDE before and after curriculum implementation was determined using department billing data. Results: 20 residents and 10 nurses underwent the curriculum. During the first phase, 10 residents trained individually. All 10 failed the pre-test and passed the post-test. During the second phase, 7 resident-nurse teams were trained. 6 teams failed the pre-test and all 7 passed the post-test. During the third phase, chief residents who had passed the curriculum trained 3 additional resident-nurse teams. All 3 failed the pre-test and all passed the post-test. During the 6 academic years (2006-12) preceding curriculum implementation, a mean of 1.7 (range 0 to 4) LCBDEs per year were performed at our institution, as compared to a mean of 8.3 (range 5 to 13) per year after implementation (2012-present) (p<.05). All LCBDEs in the post-curriculum period were performed by residents who had undergone the curriculum, and 58 % of these cases were performed by attending surgeons who did not have prior clinical experience with LCBDE. Over the study period, the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed yearly did not change significantly. Conclusion: A resident curriculum for LCBDE resulted in increased clinical utilization of the procedure. Further study is needed to determine the effect of this curriculum on clinical outcomes for patients with choledocholithiasis.","eng     Germany     Surg Endosc. 2016 Mar;30 Suppl 1:314-6. doi: 10.1007/s00464-016-4774-4.

A. and Hasso, A.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000336284900256,English,,,"Purpose of Study: To determine the prevalence of different diagnostic image viewing platforms used by radiologists while on-call. Also, to assess preferences and opinions amongst radiology program directors and chief residents with regards to the use of these image viewing platforms. Methods Used: An online survey was sent electronically to radiology residency program directors and chief residents via the Association of Program Directors in Radiology and the American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology, respectively. Summary of Results: 42 radiology program directors and 25 chief residents completed the survey, yielding response rates of 24.9% and 8.5% respectively. From the survey results 10 different Picture Archiving Communications Systems (PACS) were identified; GE (25%), Philips (16%), and Agfa Impax (16%) were the most prevalent. Interestingly, only 5% of all respondents report using a secondary Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) viewer different from PACS for on-call studies. Additionally, 41% of respondents report their institution's PACS is not integrated into its Electronic Medical Records (EMR). In general, perceptions of PACS functionality were neutral to weakly positive. The majority of respondents strongly agreed that it is important to have a single integrated PACS for viewing on-call studies, and agreed that EMR should be integrated into PACS. Conclusions: The vast majority of respondents (95%) use their home institution's PACS while on-call. The 5% that use a secondary DICOM viewer instead do so because of a lack of availability or access to their institution's PACS for on-call studies. The results show there is still a wide variety of PACS platforms used by different institutions. However, GE, Philips, and Agfa Impax represent over 50% of all platforms used by survey respondents. Most radiologists surveyed have neutral to slightly positive perceptions about the functionality and ease of use of their PACS, however 10% of respondents believe their PACS is difficult to use and increases their radiologist report turnaround time. Furthermore, while radiologists agree that PACS should be integrated with EMR, only 53% of respondents report having this arrangement.","Ah7ap     246     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Theodore Reich, a founding member and the first president of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics, died on 25 December 2003. Although he died at what is now considered the young age of 65 years, he published well over 200 papers and articles, of which I was privileged to be the coauthor on a few. Many of these papers have become classics. He completed his undergraduate and medical training at McGill University in Montreal as well as an internship at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. He then moved to St Louis to do psychiatric training at this institution, becoming chief resident. Except for a 2-year post-doc at the University of Edinburgh in the Department of Genetics, his entire career was spent at this institution. Theodore Reich helped provide the scientific community in general, and the psychiatric community specifically, with the tools for the types of studies we do today. He brought genes back into the genetics of psychiatric disorders and he was instrumental in shepherding the growth of this field from a nascent disorganized nebula of ideas into a thriving entity making good on its promise for better understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders.

K. and Fang, Y.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000340996203061,English,,,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Prevention of avoidable readmissions and improvement of patient throughput are high priority initiatives, yet there is no standard discharge process for residents to follow. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): 1. Improve readmission rate and patient throughput for patients cared for by a teaching service. 2. Empower residents to lead quality improvement (QI) initiatives. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): Our QI team is located at a large community-based teaching hospital and consists of a 12 person transitional residency, two chief residents, and three hospitalist faculty physicians. All team members completed the IHI Open School QI modules. During the first team meeting, readmission prevention, improvement in hospital throughput, and the teach back technique were reviewed. The residents subsequently designed a best practice discharge process with a checklist in the electronic medical record. The intervention, enumerated in the checklist, consisted of 1) determining risk of readmission, using the Society of Hospital Medicine The 8P's Risk Assessment Tool, 2) advanced notification and engagement of patients, families, and team members regarding discharge, 3) reminders to arrange early outpatient follow up appointments, 4) prompts to educate patients about their diagnosis and medications, and 5) in person resident-to-patient medication and diagnosis education using teach back. Residents were encouraged to perform the intervention for patients who were at high risk for readmission. When the intervention was completed, a final progress note with the checklist was generated and sent to the chief residents for record keeping. The QI team performed successive PDSA cycles with the goal of increasing the number of patients exposed to the intervention. The primary solution was to capitalize on the inherent competitive spirit of many of the interns by publicly displaying performance at morning report. High performing residents were able to advise their colleagues on how to perform this intervention more efficiently. Patients cared for by the teaching service who were not exposed to the intervention during the same time period, served as a comparison group. Future PDSA cycles will focus on refining specific components of the intervention until readmission and throughput goals are met. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/ INTERVENTION): The QI team is tallying the number of interventions completed per week. Hospital administrative data is being utilized to determine 30 day readmission rates and will eventually be used to adjust outcome rates for differences in diagnosis, severity of illness, and other risk factors for readmission. Bed management data is being utilized to determine timing of discharge order and discharge time. Resident experience with the QI process and patient satisfaction with the intervention will be measured using survey instruments and focus groups. Direct observation using the University of Iowa Teach-back Observation Tool will be used to measure usage of the teach back technique and time spent during patient education. Finally, adherence to follow up and patient disease and medication knowledge will be assessed using patient questionnaires. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE eFINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): A total of 254 patients were exposed to the intervention between September 2013 and December 2013. After resident performance was publicly displayed, the number of interventions per week increased from 7 per week to 19 per week. During October 2013, intervention data was available for 102 patients. This group of patients was at high risk of readmission. Forty-six patients (45 %) were aged 65 years or older, and 73 patients (72 %) were Medicare, Medicaid, or self-pay patients. Sepsis, pneumonia, heart failure, or GI hem rrhage was the primary discharge diagnosis in 78.4% of patients. Thirty-two percent of patients reported a hospitalization within the prior 6 months, and 13 % were hospitalized in our own health system within the previous month. Nearly 20%of patients were taking at least two high risk medications, and 65%of patients met criteria for poly-pharmacy. The median case mix index (CMI) was 1.48. The comparison group, consisting of 331 patients, had a similar profile to the intervention group in terms of age, payor, and diagnosis. However, the median CMI was 14 % lower than in the intervention group. The 30 day readmission rate, within our five hospital health system, in the intervention group was 12.6 % versus a 15.4 % rate in the comparison group. The average time between discharge order and discharge time was 163 min in the intervention group versus 267 min in the comparison group. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Empowering residents to lead a QI initiative can be effective in improving use of an intervention. Pilot data suggests that following a standard discharge process, with a checklist embedded in an electronic medical record, can result in improvements in 30 day readmission rates and patient throughput.","Suppl. 1     Ao0jz     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Historically, this has been via direct supervision by senior surgeons. There has been a push for the development and use of validated curricula. We assess robotics curricula (RC) and surgical simulation (SS) in U.S. urology residency programs (URPs). METHODS: Of all URPs, 129 were contacted. Program directors (PDs) were queried on use of a formal or validated RC, use of virtual reality (VR), graduation requirements, availability of a SS laboratory, and chief resident comfort level with robotic surgery. RESULTS: Response rate was 26.3 %. Of PDs, 17 (50%) reported a formalized RC but 82.3% did not utilize validated RC. Physical consoles exist in 73.5% and VR trainers exist in 50% of programs. Simulation laboratories were reported in 85.2% of programs. Completion of a RC was required for graduation in 38.2% while it was suggested in 50% of programs. Six programs (17.6%) are undergoing curriculum development/validation. Figure 3 outlines PD perceptions of chief resident operative comfort. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the majority (82.3%) of URPs do not employ validated RC. However, half of PDs report using VR modules, physical consoles, and online courses. By graduation, 91.1% of PDs reported that graduating chief residents are comfortable with robotic surgery. (Figure Presented).","Suppl.

With the implementation of a new resident acute care surgery service managed by our senior residents with attending supervision, we sought understand if autonomy for laparoscopic procedures had improved and if our residents ranked their confidence and autonomy equivalent to open procedures. Methods: All general surgery residents over a one-year period completed self evaluations on individual operative case performance. For each procedure, an attending evaluation of the resident's performance was also submitted. We compared evaluations for laparoscopic abdominal procedures to open abdominal procedures and further analyzed those evaluations specific to the resident acute care surgery service as compared to attending services. Results: A total of 1775 resident evaluations were collected for abdominal cases. Of these, 1072 cases were laparoscopic cases and 703 were performed open. On average both residents and attendings ranked resident's performance on laparoscopic procedures significantly higher than open procedures in all categories: knowledge of procedure, intraoperative communication and overall grade. Additionally, Zwisch scale of autonomy was significantly higher for laparoscopy compared to open by both attendings and residents (2.70 vs 2.35 and 2.52 vs 2.19 respectively, p\0.001). When we compared evaluations for laparoscopic cases done under the resident acute care service compared to attending services, residents' ranking of Zwisch scale of autonomy was significantly higher on the resident acute service (3.27 vs 2.36, p\0.001) and similarly attendings' ranking of Zwisch scale of autonomy was also higher on the resident service (3.20 vs 2.54, p\0.001). Conclusions: The highest ratings of autonomy were give to laparoscopic procedures on the resident acute care surgery service when both compared to procedures performed on attending services and when compared to open procedures. We conclude that the structure of a resident acute care surgery service highly increases the autonomy and confidence of chief residents with laparoscopy prior to graduation.","eng     News     Germany     Surg Endosc. 2018 Apr;32(Suppl 1):130-359. doi: 10.1007/s00464-018-6121-4.

Objectives: The objective of this study is to identify which application variables predict chief resident appointment and those that are associated with the need for remediation during residency. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study using an existing database from graduated classes of nine residency programs. For each graduate, pre-specified predictor variables (Table 1) were collected. The outcome variables of interest were chief resident appointment and need for remediation. Results: Data from 277 residents was analyzed. Comparison between chiefs and non-chiefs showed a significantly higher proportion of chiefs who were awarded AOA designation (18.6% vs 9.1%, P=0.048). Chiefs also obtained higher mean scores on the USMLE step 2 CK exam, all categorical measures on the EM Standardized Letter of Recommendation (SLOR) and higher scores in surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics and family medicine clerkships. Compared with residents not requiring remediation, residents requiring remediation had significantly lower USMLE step 1 (214 vs 220, p=0.0153) and 2 CK (219 vs 230, p =0.00106) scores, lived further from their permanent home mailing address and received a greater number of other awards in their undergraduate years. Conclusion: Many data points reviewed by program directors have a correlation with becoming chief resident and some with those requiring remediation. While pre-existing data might help predict chief resident appointment, several variables have also been identified that may help identify residents at risk for requiring remediation during residency.

A specific and potentially severe complication of LSG is the staple line leakage (SLL) that may occur in up to 7% of cases. Technical errors, stapling line crossing, poor vascularization, and gastric inflammation are the potential underlying mechanisms of this feared complication. No preventive measures were clearly identified at this point. Aims: The aim of this study is to analyze the rate and management of SLL in a prospective cohort of LSG. Patients and Methods: Between July 2005 and July 2011, 378 patients (319 women/59 men) underwent LSG performed by chief residents (n = 287) and a senior consultant in bariatric surgery (n = 91). A five trocar technique was used. After mobilization of the greater curvature of the stomach the gastric resection was performed by successive firings of 4.5 mmhigh staples (Endo GIATM 60 mm)at the antrum and 3.5 or 4.5 mm-high staples at the gastric body and fundus towards the left diaphragmatic crus, depending on the thickness of the stomach. A 36F bougie was used to calibrate the gastric tube. The staple line was systematically reinforced with a running suture. All patients received a standardized post-operative care protocol including Proton-Pump Inhibitors and Thromboprophylaxis. Patients were on liquid diet from Postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD15. Results: Staple line leakage occurred in 9 patients (2.38%), at the level of the cardia in all cases. The first leak occurred after 131 consecutive uneventful procedures. Rate of fistula was 6/287 and 3/91 after procedures performed by chief residents and senior respectively (p: 0.25). No demographic data were found as potential predictors of SLL. Mean Charlson Comorbidity Score was higher in patients presenting a leak (1.84 vs. 1.37) but score classes were equally distributed in both groups. Patients were managed by combined laparoscopic (n = 2) or open (n = 1) exploration, drainage and endoscopic self-expandable covered stent (SECS), CT-guided percutaneous drainage alone (n = 2) or a SECS alone (n = 4). Medical support including total parenteral nutrition and adapted antibiotics was started in all the patients. Patients with SLL had a longer mean length of hospital stay (LOS) (19 days; range 3-56 vs. 3 days 3-5); and required multiple re-admissions (mean 2.85, range 1-6), which represents a mean of 29.28 additional hospital days. Median LOS according to the treatment modality was 41 days (range 26-56) vs. 18 (range 3-33) vs. 7 (range 5-16) in the surgical drainage + stent vs. percutaneous drainage vs. stenting alone groups respectively. The combined treatment modalities were successful in all the cases and patients were totally asymptomatic at the follow up. Conclusions: Staple line leakage, which occurred in 9/378 (2.38%) of our patients, is a severe and unpredictable complication of LSG. Experience has demonstrated that endoscopic stenting is a key-point of the management of SLL, combined eventually with other treatment modalities.","L71482011     2014-07-21 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Methods: An online survey of EM residency programs was conducted during the 2011-2012 academic year. The survey was distributed by the CORD listserv, as well as directly to program directors. Responses were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics. Results: Of 159 allopathic programs, 99 (65%) programs responded.

J. and Sgro, G.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000392201603261,English,,,"NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: In response to the ACGME's Next Accreditation System and CLER program, residency leaders have been working to increase trainee engagement in patient safety and quality improvement (QI). While traditional morbidity and mortality (M&M) conference remains the dominant model for discussing medical error among physicians, the content of these conferences varies widely and often focuses on human rather than systems error. If we really want residents to appreciate how errors occur in complex systems and to improve care for our patients, traditional M&M format needs to be re-focused. We re-engineered M&M at our VA setting into our Quality Improvement Conference (QUIC). By the end of each session, residents will: 1. Describe how latent errors lead to adverse events and near misses 2. Perform a contributing factors analysis on an actual case 3. List local processes for addressing error and mitigating risks SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The 60-min QUIC conference is delivered monthly to Internal Medicine trainees and medical students. The discussion is led by our Chief Resident in Quality and Patient Safety accompanied by a faculty facilitator. We plan to expand into a multidisciplinary conference with participation from other specialties and clinical areas. DESCRIPTION: In an effort to combine an open forum for discussing adverse events with instruction on QI methodology, we overhauled M&M conference at our VA site. Rather than selecting only the worst patient outcomes for discussion, we select cases involving serious or multiple systemic errors for our Quality Improvement Conference (QUIC). We begin by leading trainees through an interactive case presentation and an introduction to root cause analysis. Attendees then identify contributing factors in small groups before reconvening to brainstorm potential interventions. We conclude by disclosing how our local QI offices are addressing the issues raised and by reviewing the event reporting process. EVALUATION: Preliminary feedback is generally positive. Residents are gaining a better understanding of the process for addressing incident reports as well as hands-on experience using common QI techniques with which they were previously unfamiliar. In addition, they note an increased likelihood of reporting adverse events in the future. A comparison between evaluations for traditional M&M and QUIC format is pending with results available later this spring. Ultimately, we hope to capture increased resident engagement in our patient safety culture as measured by our annual program evaluation and a positive impact on CLER visits. DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: We restructured M&Minto a novel interactive conference that ushers the discussion of adverse events into the era of quality improvement and patient safety. Our QUIC conference engages trainees in the foundations of QI and bolsters ACGME competencies in systems-based practice and practice-based learning. This represents a fresh approach that provides a foundation for a longitudinal quality curriculum.","Suppl. 2     Ei0yl     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Older hip fracture patients who receive operative repair within 48 hours of injury have better post-operative outcomes compared with patients who experience a delay.We developed an evidence based algorithm intended to reduce delays resulting from disagreements regarding admitting service and/or treatment strategies.The success of this clinical pilot is partially dependent upon engaging emergency medicine, internal medicine and orthopaedic surgery clinicians in the implementation process. Aim: To describe the process of fostering continued multidisciplinary support for a new clinical initiative. Methods: Led by the efforts of chief residents from orthopaedics and internal medicine, and with the full support of the orthopaedic surgery and medicine chairs, an admission algorithm for older hip fracture patients was implemented atVA Connecticut in January 2010.The clinical algorithmwas designed to helpEmergencyMedicine providers determinewhether older emergent hip fracture patients should be admitted to medicine or orthopaedic surgery, given their pre-operative risk factors. Results: Thus far the hip fracture admission algorithm has been utilized for 16 patients; 7 were admitted to Medicine and 9 to orthopaedics. Emergency medicine satisfaction with the algorithm has been persistently high. Initial feedback from Medical and Orthopaedic residents indicated the algorithm was well received but, given the sole focus on the admission process, did not eliminate disputes regarding which service was responsible for directing care during the peri-operative period. To address this issue, we expanded the algorithm and highlighted the role of the geriatrics consult service for peri-operative decision making. Another issue was that awareness of the clinical pilot waned when the new class of residents started in July 2010. Conclusion: Improving the process of care for older hip fracture patients requires attention to both the admission and peri-operative periods. Successful implementation of a clinical initiative that involves physicians in training may require flexibility and ongoing dissemination efforts, especially during the initial stages. Effective methods to establish long term support may include identifying chief resident champions and regular educational sessions.","Suppl. 1     750dj     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The objective was also to demonstrate the effectiveness of our institution's minimally invasive training program, including both laparoscopic and robotic procedures. Methods: We performed a chart review of all laparoscopic and robotic cholecystectomies from January 1, 2014-December 31, 2015 performed at Princeton Baptist Medical Center. Over 160 cases were performed by attending physicians and chief surgery residents (PGY5). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test. Results: We analyzed operative time between attending physicians and chief residents in laparoscopic as well as robotic cholecystectomy. We found no significant difference in operative between attending physicians vs. PGY5 residents in laparoscopic or robotic cholecystectomy times (see Table). [TABLE PRESENTED] Conclusion: ACGME case requirements for surgical training include basic and advanced laparoscopic cases. Competence in operative technique is often subjective, with little objective data. No statistically significant difference exists at our program between chief resident and attending surgeon operative time on a common minimally invasive operation, in both laparoscopic and robotic approaches. Training in robotic surgery during surgical residency is important in preparing today's trainee general surgeon. Establishing a standardized curriculum for robotic surgery during residency is an effective tool for developing this new skill. Robotic assistance increased overall operative time by an average of 21.5 and 15.8 min for attending surgeons and chief residents, respectively. Our mean operative times match or are superior to published mean operative times. Competence in performing basic laparoscopic operations can be assessed by recording and tracking operative times. Our robotic curriculum is effective in training residents to competently perform a common general surgery operation by the PGY-5 year.","eng     News     Germany     Surg Endosc. 2017 Mar;31(Suppl 1):137-334. doi: 10.1007/s00464-017-5445-9.

However, no data regarding the relative frequency (prevalence) of these three FHR categories during labor or its clinical use were presented. In addition, it is well known that significant interobserver variability exists in the interpretation of FHR patterns. Therefore, the aims of this study were to: 1) establish the relative frequency (prevalence) of the three FHR categories during labor; and 2) examine the interobserver variability utilizing this new FHR classification system. STUDY DESIGN: We included singleton pregnancies >34 weeks' gestation who had an umbilical artery cord pH performed during a fourmonth period at our institution (n = 102). We categorized the fetal heart rate pattern during the last 60 minutes prior to delivery according to the NICHD three-tier system. Three separate Obstetricians at different levels of training (MFM Attending, Fellow, and Chief Resident) independently categorized the FHR patterns using the NICHD criteria. A Kappa coefficient was calculated to assess the interobserver variability of category classification. A Kappa of 0.81-0.99 is considered almost perfect agreement, 0.61-0.80 substantial agreement, 0.41-0.60 moderate agreement, 0.21-0.40 fair agreement, and 0.01-0.20 is slight agreement. RESULTS: The median gestational age at delivery was 39 2/7 weeks (34 -41 2/7). Seventeen tracings (17%) were determined to be category I tracings, eighty (79%) category II, and four (4%) category III. One tracing could not be categorized. The calculated Kappa coefficient among the three observers was 0.50 indicating moderate agreement in interpretation. CONCLUSION: The overwhelming majority of the tracings (79%) were category II. There is moderate agreement in the interpretation of fetal heart rate categories using the NICHD Three-Tier Fetal Heart Rate Interpretation System. The clinical value (predictive ability) of this new classification should determined by future studies.","L70129075     2010-05-19 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Residents may feel that their schedule is unfair or biased in regard to the type of shift assigned, based on who creates it. Residents also may feel that a handmade schedule subjects them to human error, leading to increased fatigue, exhaustion, and lower job satisfaction overall. Objectives: This study assessed resident satisfaction with a handmade schedule by the chief residents versus a Web-based scheduling solution, MedRez.net. Our hypothesis was that residents would perceive a computer-assisted schedule as more fair. Methods: This was an IRB-approved, retrospective survey of the 36 residents at the University of Connecticut Integrated Residency in Emergency Medicine. The study tool consisted of a written 5-question survey with a 5-point Likert scale, and subjects were asked to circle the response that they thought that most reflected their answer. Results: The median, mode, minimum, and maximum score of each survey question was computed, ranging from 1 to 5. The median resident satisfaction with the schedule was 4 (range 2 to 5). Perception of fairness of handmade schedule was 4 (range 3 to 5). Perception of fairness using Medrez.net was 3 (range 2 to 4). Perceived disruption in circadian rhythm with handmade schedule was 3 (range 2 to 5). Overall fairness of computer-generated versus a handmade schedule was 3 (range 1 to 4). Conclusions: Residents were satisfied with the schedule whether it was created by hand or with computer assistance. The computer-assisted schedule allows the chief residents to quickly detect errors and a lack of shift uniformity among residents, and the ACGME work hour limitations are hard-wired into the schedule to prevent duty hour violations entirely. We believe this ultimately results in greater overall satisfaction among the residents and improved perception of equity in the scheduling process.","L71279581     2014-01-08 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Materials/Methods: An anonymous web-based survey of chief residents (US) and residency program directors (Canada) was performed. Questions were designed to assess patient volume, treatment complexity and general chart round practices. Results: Fifty-nine of 91 (65%) responded (US, n = 57; Canada, n = 2). Over 80% of institutions review all external beam treatments. Rates were much lower for other modalities (radiosurgery 60%; brachytherapy 50%). Notably, 42% of institutions never review prostate brachytherapy cases, while 31% never review gynecologic brachytherapy cases. Patient history, chart documentation and dose prescription were reviewed in >79% institutions, while the finer details of dosimetry (beams, wedges), isodose coverage, IMRT constraints, dose-volume histograms were reviewed only in 62%, 59%, 40% and 50% of cases respectively. Cone beam images were never reviewed in 51% of institutions. The median number of patients on treatment at any one time was between 100 and 125. 58% of responding institutions hold chart-rounds for less than 2 hours per week. The median amount of time spent per patient was 3.4 minutes (range, 0.7-12). To provide a context in which quality assurance practices could be analyzed, we ascertained the range of highly complex treatments available at each institution, such as SBRT or pelvic IMRT. The median number of highly complex-techniques available was 8 (out of a max 9). No correlation was found between the complexity of techniques used and the time spent per patient for QA purposes. Chart-rounds led to both minor and major treatment changes. 65% of institutions report that minor alterations (defined as a small MLC change/re-port-film) after chart-rounds were made to less than 10% of treatment plans, while 32% report minor changes to 10 - 30% of treatment plans. 75% of institutions report that less than 10% of treatment plans require a major alteration (change to dose prescription or re-plan with dosimetry), while 11% report major changes to 10 - 30% of treatment plans. 14% of institutions never make major treatment plan alterations, while 2% never make minor alterations. Conclusions: The practice of QA chart-rounds appears inconsistent amongst North American academic institutions. Despite the fact that chart rounds seldom review the full range of critical data available since the advent of 3D planning, changes are nonetheless frequently made. Brachytherapy and radiosurgical procedures are rarely reviewed. The potential effect of a more thorough QA review on patient outcomes is not known, but may be an increasing area of government and medical-legal scrutiny.","Suppl.

The report described the epidemiology of, provided a formal definition for, and suggested improvement goals for diagnostic error. Based on the goals of the IOM report, we aimed to assess Internal Medicine residents' and faculty's education and training in the diagnostic process, work system and culture around the diagnostic process and the reporting environment for diagnostic error. Methods: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional, mixed methods, survey study. Survey content was derived from the IOM's second, fifth, and sixth goals for a total of eight multiple choice questions. Some representative topics and their respective answer choices included: whether training program teaches communication about diagnostic error (single answer- Yes, No, Unsure); how trainees are encouraged to report diagnostic error (all that apply- not encouraged, senior resident, chief resident, attending, program director, electronic reporting program); comfort reporting diagnostic errors (single answer- very uncomfortable to very comfortable). From June 2016 to March 2017, surveys were administered anonymously via e-mail or by paper during in-person educational conferences. We targeted residents and faculty in Traditional Internal-Medicine, Primary Care Internal Medicine, and Internal Medicine-Pediatrics at nine community and University-based training programs in Connecticut. Comparison testing across institution, experience, and self-reported gender was performed using Pearson's chisquared test on STATA© software. Results: Of 484 physicians (87 attendings, 397 residents) targeted, 266 (70 attendings, 196 residents) responded. 158 (59.3%) surveys were inperson and 196 (73.7%) were from residents. Less trainees than attendings reported that their training program taught residents how to communicate about diagnostic errors (43.5% Yes v. 64.7% Yes, p <0.01). Less trainees felt comfortable reporting diagnostic errors when they occur (55.4% comfortable v. 69.1% comfortable, p = 0.05).

These milestones address the knowledge, skills, abilities, attitudes, and experiences that a resident is expected to progress through during the course of training. Even prior to the initiation of the milestones, there was a paucity of EM literature addressing the remediation of problem resident behaviors and there remain few readily accessible tools to aid in the implementation of a remediation plan. The goal of the Problem Resident Behavior Guide is to provide specific strategies for resident remediation based on deficiencies identified within the framework of the EM milestones. Methods: The Problem Resident Behavior Guide is a written instructional manual that provides concrete examples of remediation strategies to address specific milestone deficiencies. The more than 200 strategies stem from the experiences of former chief residents and program directors at a single institution, supplemented by recommendations from educational leaders at other institutions as well as the utilization of valuable education adjuncts, such as focused simulation exercises, lecture preparation, and themed ED shifts. Most recommendations require active participation by the resident with guidance by faculty to achieve the remediation expectations. Conclusion: The ACGME outcomes-based milestones aid in the identification of deficiencies with regards to resident performance without providing recommendations on remediation. The Problem Resident Behavior Guide can therefore have a significant impact by filling in this gap. We fully expect to incorporate feedback from multiple institutions to provide updated versions as we continue to implement the milestonebased competencies.","L71668337     2014-11-07 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Microscope is a word coming from two ancient Greek words, ????ó? meaning 'small', and ??o??? meaning 'to see'. It is an instrument used to see objects that are too small for the naked eye. The first microscope was claimed to be invented in 1590 by Zacharias Janssen, a spectacle-maker, who tried to find a way to make magnification even greater to help people with seriously poor eyesight. The first operating microscope, a monocular microscope, was built in 1921 in the University of Stockholm by Carl-Olof Siggesson Nyl'n, a Swedish otolaryngologist. He was the first to use the microscope to perfom surgeries initially on animals. In November 1921, he used the microscope to operate on the first patient, with a labyrinthine fistula. The binocular microscope that we use now was developed in 1922, by Carl's colleague Gunnar Holmgren. The most obvious developments in microsurgery have been procedures allowing anastomosis of successively smaller blood vessels and nerves which have allowed transfer of tissue from one part of the body to another and reattachment of severed parts. Before the term 'microsurgery' appeared, vascular anastomosis was performed since 1896, well beyond the birth of operating microscope. John Benjamin Murphy, an American physician, successfully anastomosed a femoral artery severed by gunshot wound in 1897. In 1902, Alexis Carrel, a French surgeon, originated the method of triangulation for arterial and venous anastomosis. In 1908, he devised methods for transplantation of whole organs. In 1912, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for pioneering vascular anastomosis techniques and in recognition of his work on organ transplantation. The Second World War catalysed the advancement of vascular surgery. Establishment of antibiotics, improvement in infection control, and development of fine sutures and instruments improved the results of vascular surgery and resulted in successful anastomosis of small vessels >3mm. The first surgery using microscope to aid in vascular anastomosis was done by Jules Jacobson, a vascular surgeon of the University of Vermont, who described the anastomosis of vessels as small as 1.4mm in 1960, and first used the term 'microsurgery'. The first replantation was done in 1962, by a team of chief residents led by Ronald Malt at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. It was a replantation at the level of the proximal humerus in a 12 year old child. But a microscope was not used at that time. The first reported replantation was done in 1963 by Chen Zhongwei in Shanghai 6th People's Hospital in China. It was a distal forearm replantation in a mechanist. The first revascularization of a finger, a partially amputated thumb, was done in 1963, by Harold Kleinert of the University of Louisville Hand Clinic. The first replantation of finger, a completely amputated thumb, was done in 1965, by Shigeo Komatsu and Susumu Tamai of the Medical University of Nara Prefecture. In 1966, Yang Dongyue and Gu Yudong in Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, China, did the first toe-hand transfer (2nd toe to thumb transfer). He then reported the first free groin flap in 1973. The first clinically successful free bone graft (fibula) with microvascular anastomosis was reported by Taylor In 1975. Chen Zhongwei reported on a patient with Volkman's contracture who underwent a free pectoralis major transfer for reconstruction of flexor muscles in 1975. With the huge number of injury cases, especially in the countries with rapid industrial growth, microsurgery became increasingly important. In the field of hand surgery, the scope of microsurgery extended from just vascular repair, to restoration of severed parts (replantation), to tissue transfer to compensate defects and to improve functions. Microsurgery generally means doing surgery under microscope. When the microscope has to be prepared for a hand operation, people would instantly perceive that the operation is labour intensive, demands long hours an patience, and is a tiring and hard work. With the advancement of technology and bioengineering medicine, many surgeons may put microsurgery at the bottom of their treatment options exhausting many other treatment alternatives despite more expensive costs and less effective results. However, this should not be the real world of microsurgery. Microsurgery is a concept, meaning 'wide', 'deep' and 'fine'. It treats a wide variety of diseases, such as defects resulted from post-traumatic, post-infective, tumour excision and congenital conditions. And, in fact, microsurgeries are performed widely in many specialties including spine, ophthalmology, gynaecology, ENT, neurosurgery, maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery etc. With the magnified view under the microscope, a different world is seen. There is a broader and deeper understanding of a condition and disease. Microsurgery gives us a wider field of view instead of a pinhole vision. It helps us to form a more accurate diagnosis, and provides us a better platform, under the microscope, to precisely treat a disease. Arthroscopy is an example of the concept of microsurgery. With a magnified field, a clearer pathology is seen and treated under the magnified environment. Microsurgery also represents 'deep'. It does not only replenish the wound defect, but also structures deeply, including bone, joint, muscle, tendon, as a composite transfer and as a functional reconstruction. With improving technology, more advanced microscopes, sophisticated instruments and suture materials, many technical problems related to microsurgery are solved. Much finer microsurgery can be done. Distal replantation, especially in children, is an example. The distal part, previously discarded, can now be preserved, and the best quality of tissue is restored to the finger with good hand function, sensibility, psychological well-being and cosmesis. Microsurgery represents 'fine'. Finer and smaller caliber of structures are repaired. Higher cosmetic results are aimed. Donor sites are more respected. Koshima introduced perforator flaps in microsurgery, which renders the surgery less invasive, and can be more suitable for the recipient sites as they provide higher flexibility and choices for donor tissue. Supermicrosurgery enables unique operations that seemed impossible earlier, such as true perforator flaps, lymphaticovenular anastomosis. Telemicrosurgery, the installation of robot in microsurgery, makes complex microsurgeries feasible, such as brachial plexus surgery. We should not see the general meaning of microsurgery. It is a concept, embracing wide, deep and fine. It allows to magnify, to see more, to do more, do better and help more. Until we can invent a medication which can be ingested and reforms an absent part, microsurgery will remain a precious mainstay of treatment.","L617770716     2017-08-18 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

On average, there was one associate program director for every 33 residents, one chief resident for every 27 residents, and one staff person for every 21 residents. Most programs provided trainees with incremental educational stipends, meals while oncall, travel and meeting expenses, and parking. Support from pharmaceutical companies was used for meals, books, and meeting expenses. Almost all programs provided meals for applicants, with 15% providing travel allowances and 37% providing lodging. The programs' board pass rates significantly correlated with the numbers of faculty fulltime equivalents (FTEs), the numbers of resident FTEs per office staff FTEs, and the numbers of categorical and preliminary applications received and ranked by the programs in 1998 and 1999. Regression analyses demonstrated three independent predictors of the programs' board pass rates: number of faculty (a positive predictor), percentage of clinical work performed by the program director (a negative predictor), and financial support from pharmaceutical companies (also a negative predictor). CONCLUSIONS: These results identify benchmarks of financial and staff support provided to internal medicine residency programs. Some of these benchmarks are correlated with board pass rate, an accepted indicator of quality in residency training. Program directors and chairs can use this information to identify areas that may benefit from enhanced financial and administrative support.","Wolfsthal, Susan D     Beasley, Brent W     Kopelman, Richard     Stickley, William     Gabryel, Timothy     Kahn, Marc J     eng     Acad Med. 2002 Jan;77(1):50-6.

A problem resident is defined by the American Board of Internal Medicine as ""a trainee who demonstrates a significant enough problem that requires intervention by someone of authority."" Data are sparse regarding identification and management of such residents. OBJECTIVE: To gain more understanding of the prevalence, identification, management, and prevention of problem residents within US internal medicine residency programs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mailed survey of all 404 internal medicine residency program directors in the United States in October 1999, of whom 298 (74%) responded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of problem residents; type of problems encountered; factors associated with identification and management of problem residents. RESULTS: The mean point prevalence of problem residents during academic year 1998-1999 was 6.9% (SD, 5.7%; range, 0%-39%), and 94% of programs had problem residents. The most frequently reported difficulties of problem residents were insufficient medical knowledge (48%), poor clinical judgment (44%), and inefficient use of time (44%). Stressors and depression were the most frequently identified underlying problems (42% and 24%, respectively). The most frequent processes by which problem residents were discovered included direct observation (82%) and critical incidents (59%). Chief residents and attending physicians most frequently identified problem residents (84% and 76%, respectively); problem residents rarely identified themselves (2%). Many program directors believed that residents who are from an underrepresented minority, are international medical graduates, or are older than 35 years are at increased risk of being identified as a problem resident (P<.05). Program directors believed that frequent feedback sessions (65%) and an assigned mentor for structured supervision (53%) were the most helpful interventions. CONCLUSION: Nearly all internal medicine residency programs in this sample had problem residents, whose presenting characteristics and underlying issues were diverse and complex.

A.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000264448502255,English,,,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Although training in infertility is an integral component of urology residency, we have a poor understanding of the competence of our residents in performing vasovasostomy (VV). We sought to evaluate current resident experiences and expectations with VV as well as viewpoints regarding infertility fellowship training and future practice. METHODS: Surveys were developed to evaluate resident training in infertility, opinions on the necessity of fellowship training, and planned practice patterns. Questionnaires were sent electronically in the spring of 2008 to chief residents and first year graduates. We used logistic regression analysis to determine the likelihood of perceived need for fellowship training and plans to practice vasovasostomy based on number of cases done during residency. RESULTS: Surveys were sent to 235 chief residents and first year graduates, and 95(40% response rate) responses were received. The vast majority (87%) of respondents believe that residents should be trained in VV during residency, yet only 36% believe that their training in this procedure is adequate. A minority of respondents (26%) performed greater than 5 VVs during their residency. Most respondents (68%) believe that fellowship training should be required to perform this procedure. Only 28% of chiefs and recent graduates plan to perform this procedure in practice with inadequate training being the most common reason (52%) for not performing it. Both the perceived need for fellowship and plans to perform VV in practice were significantly related to the number of cases performed during residency. All individuals who performed greater than 10 cases during their training plan to perform this procedure and believe that fellowship training is not necessary to perform VV in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Recent graduates of urology programs believe training in VV during residency is important, yet the actual experience remains inconsistent. It is apparent that viewpoints on the necessity of fellowship training in infertility and plans to perform this procedure in future practice are dependent on the surgeon's experience with VV during residency. Performing at least 10 cases represents a threshold at which point trainees universally feel comfortable with this procedure.","422sr     2014     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

F. and Leykum, L. and O'Rorke, J. and Bard, J. F.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000331939302381,English,,,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Scheduling the block and clinic schedules for Internal Medicine residents is a logistical challenge: many hours are required; errors can be easily made, particularly when schedules are changed; and scheduling in a way that optimizes day-to-day clinic access is almost impossible on a practical level. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): Our goal was to use systems engineering principles to optimize resident schedules in a way that allows for the greatest availability in continuity clinics and improves patient access to primary care physicians. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): We sought to apply principles from systems engineering to the problem of resident scheduling. Our Internal Medicine residency program has 87 residents, 77 of whom are categorical with primary care clinics. We considered this a scheduling problem related to control or disruption management. We first identified the hard constraints in the scheduling process, which includes days off, required rotations, and clinic availability during each rotation. These constraints could not be violated. We also identified the soft constraints that would optimally be followed, such as maximizing the trainee to supervising physician ratio in clinic. We wrote a scheduling program in C++ that included these constraints, assigning a weight to each that reflected its importance. This program was run in Windows 7 on a PC laptop with an i5 processor and 4GB of memory. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): We compared the output of the program with the schedule done by hand monthly over a 7-month period with regard to number and type of constraint violations, allowing us to refine the program and the approach to the constraints. We also compared performance of the by-hand and programmed schedules with regard to number of clinic sessions, number of underutilized sessions, and ability to schedule two weekly sessions on the same day rather than different days. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): The total number of clinic sessions assigned by the programmed schedule increased by 2.3 % a month, or 22.6 clinic sessions/month. This translates into the ability to accommodate approximately 130 additional appointments each month, improving patient access. The number of underutilized clinic sessions decreased by 12.9 %/month. Finally, for residents who had 2 clinics/week, the percent of time that they were assigned these clinics on the same day increased by 8.9 %/month. The final program allowed no hard constraint violations. The by-hand schedule allowed a total of 12 constraints during this period (0 to 4/month). These constraint violations led to a suboptimal ratio of housestaff to attendings in the clinic during these sessions. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Our approach to scheduling using an optimized program process is superior to a schedule done by hand. Interfacing our program with the commercial product we use to make the schedule available on the internet was initially a challenge. Our solution is cutting and pasting the program output into this product. We also had to create the program in a way that allows an interface that can be used by the Chief Residents. Updating the program as changes are made over time to our rotations and schedules will be a long-term consideration, but should not be difficult since the base program and user interface has been created. Because many of the rules for resident scheduling are mandated at the ACGME level, our program should be generally applicable to other IM residencies.","Suppl. 1     Ab6zp     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Physician education of and willingness to prescribe home phototherapy was assessed via a survey distributed at the 9th Annual Dermatology Chief Residents' Meeting. When psoriasis patients were written a prescription for home phototherapy, less than half acquired a unit.

Very few (35%) dermatology residents receive formal training on home phototherapy. When it comes to the reasons behind patients receiving significantly more expensive biologics instead of home phototherapy for their psoriasis, high copays and deductibles are just the tip of the iceberg.

Methods: The Chief Resident Incubator was designed by Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM; www.aliem.com) a digital health professions education organization in 2015, following a needs assessment in emergency medicine. A 12-month curriculum was created using constructivist social learning theory, with specific learning objectives that reflected 11 key administrative or professional development domains deemed important to chief residents. The topics covered included interviewing skills, contract negotiations, leadership, coaching, branding, conflict resolution, and ended with a focus on wellness and career longevity. A Core Leadership Team and Virtual Mentors were recruited to lead each annual iteration of the curriculum. The Incubator was implemented as a virtual community of practice using Slack, a messaging and digital communication platform. Ancillary technology such as Google Hangout on Air and Mailchimp were used to facilitate learner engagement with the curriculum. Three in person networking events were hosted at three large emergency medicine and education conferences with special medical education guests. Outcomes include chief resident participation rates, Slack activity, Google Hangout web analytics, newsletter email engagement, and scholarship. We also incorporated a hidden curriculum throughout the year with multiple online publications, competitions for guest grand round presentations, and incorporation of digital technologies in medical education. Results: A total of 584 chief residents have participated over the first 3 years of the Chief Resident Incubator; this includes chief residents from over 212 residency programs across North America. Over 27,000 messages have been shared on Slack (median 214 per week). A total of 32 Google Hangouts have occurred over the course of the inaugural Incubator including faculty mentorship from Dr. Rob Rogers, Dr. Dara Kass and Dr. Amal Mattu. A monthly newsletter was distributed to the participants with an opening rate of 59%. Scholarship included 26 published academic blog posts, 2 open access In-Training exam prepbooks, a senior level online curriculum with 9 published modules and 3 book club reviews. Conclusion: The Chief Resident Incubator is a virtual community of practice that provides longitudinal training and mentorship for chief residents. This Incubator framework may be used to design similar professional development curricula across various health professions using an online digital platform.","L622489993     2018-06-12 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>true}"

Identifying quality online resources that would also fulfill III's reporting criteria (program director monitoring, evaluation component, faculty oversight, program effectiveness) is challenging. Using crowdsourced expertise, the Approved Instructional Resources (AIR) series from Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM) was created in 2014 to provide a credible method to identify quality educational blogs and podcasts. The identified resources, however, focused on basic content with limited utility for more senior residents. We thus created the AIR-Pro series in 2015, aimed to cover more advanced concepts. Methods: The AIR-Pro series is a continuously building curriculum covering a new subject area every 2 months. For each area, 6 EM Chief Residents identify 3-5 advanced clinical questions. Using FOAMsearch.net to search blogs and podcasts, relevant posts are scored by 8 reviewers from the AIR-Pro Board (faculty and chief residents at various institutions). The scoring instrument contains 5 measurement outcomes (7-point Likert scale): recency, accuracy, educational utility, evidence based, and references. The AIR-Pro Approved label is given to posts with a score of ?28 (out of 35) points and these are featured in the blog posting. For scores of 26- 27, an Honorable Mention label is given if Board members collectively felt that they were valuable. For each AIR-Pro subject area, a multiple choice quiz is written based on the featured posts. Educator dashboard access of the Google Drive quizzes is given to program directors for monitoring. If approved by their program director, EM residents receive official III credit upon completion of each quiz. Curriculum, Tool, or Material: As of Jan 1, 2016, there have been 2 modules published on ALiEM with 1,220 (Cardiovascular) and 1,059 (Trauma) pageviews worldwide. Although early in development, 21 different institutions are using the AIR-Pro Series with over 150 residents completed the cardiovascular and trauma quizzes. We anticipate more because the original AIR Series has over 73 programs using it for III credit. Conclusion: The AIR-Pro series is a novel, objective, crowdsourced approach towards identifying quality, educational, social media content for the advanced EM resident.","L616769052     2017-06-16 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

The lack of a readily available cell source for human dental epithelial cells (ECs) severely constrains the progress of tooth bioengineering. Previous studies in model organisms have demonstrated that developing dental mesenchyme can instruct nondental epithelium to differentiate into enamel-forming epithelium. In this study, we characterized the ability of fetal and adult human dental mesenchyme to promote differentiation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived ECs (ES-ECs) into ameloblast-lineage cells. ES-ECs were co-cultured either with human fetal dental mesenchymal cells (FDMCs) or with adult dental mesenchymal cells (ADMCs) in either a three-dimensional culture system, or in the renal capsules of SOD mice. When co-cultured with FDMCs in vitro, ES-ECs polarized and expressed amelogenin. Tooth organ-like structures assembled with epithelium and encased mesenchyme and developing enamel-like structures could be detected in the complexes resulting from in vitro and ex vivo co-culture of ES-ECs and FDMCs. In contrast, co-cultured ES-ECs and ADMCs formed amorphous spherical structures and occasionally formed hair. Transcription factors were significantly upregulated in FDMCs compared to ADMCs including MSX1, GLI1, LHX6, LHX8, LEF1 and TBX1. In summary, FDMCs but not ADMCs had the capacity to induce differentiation of ES-ECs into ameloblast lineage cells. Further characterization of the functional differences between these two types of dental mesenchyme could enable reprogramming of ADMCs to enhance their odontogenic inductive competence. (C) 2013 S.

H.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000400372500436,English,,,"RATIONALE: Traditional mortality review is retrospective and focused on a small subset of deaths that are subsequently presented in a morbidity and mortality conferences. We sought to enhance the mortality review process by conducting an in-person multidisciplinary meeting shortly after almost all intensive care unit (ICU) deaths. METHODS: In 2015, we introduced Rapid Mortality Review (RMR) to the medical ICU at one academic center. Each week, treating physicians and nurses, a chief resident, and a member of the RMR quality team met in-person to review the prior week's deaths. Meetings are structured to review elements of patient care, such as communication and end-of-life discussions, and to identify specific areas for improvement. RESULTS: Between February 2015 and September 2016, we reviewed 195 deaths in the medical ICU. 19% of these deaths were expected at the time of admission to the ICU. Factors that were associated with expected deaths included admission from the emergency department and DNR/DNI orders on admission (p<0.01 for all comparisons). 73% of patients transitioned to comfort care when the medical team felt that it was appropriate. Palliative care consulted on 26% of the deaths, and these patients were less likely to undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (7% vs 28%, p<0.01). While 5% of all deaths were potentially preventable, we were able to identify areas for improvement in 46% of all patient deaths. These areas included timing of goals of care discussions, communication between the ICU and consulting teams, and transitions of care between other services and the medical ICU. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that our RMR process can be integrated into the ICU workflow and provide valuable data. Our initial experience has systematically identified opportunities for improvement in many patients who die in our ICU, such as: initiation of outpatient goals of care discussions, more frequent palliative care consultation, and improved communication and handoffs between medical services.","Et6ak     A1435     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

On days 2-5, the residents perform surgical procedures under the direction of an attending laparoscopic surgeon(s). The animals are anesthetized and attended by veterinarians and technicians. The residents perform various level appropriate procedures from basic to advanced. Familiarity with instruments and suturing techniques are emphasized. Three teams of two different training level residents are combined to assist each other. Briefing on planned operation viewed on DVD is done each day before the surgeries. Debriefing and analysis are performed daily. Written paper survey is completed at the end of the course. Results: To date we have trained 18 surgical residents. Preliminary data reveal that the all residents feel more comfortable handling laparoscopic instruments, performing suturing techniques, positioning trocars, and running the bowel. They are more confident performing complex minimally invasive procedures, such as Nissen Fundoplication, gastric bypass, intestinal resection and anastomosis, liver resection, and splenectomy, as well as handling complications such as bleeding and other intraoperative injuries. In addition, at the end of the day, the residents convert all procedures from laparoscopic to open, allowing them to evaluate their laparoscopic procedures and to practice various advanced trauma-related procedures. Conclusion: Multimodality intensive laparoscopic training course maybe a good model for training basic and advanced laparoscopic skills. The question remains: Will it translate into improved clinical operative skills? The study has been designed to follow the progress of these surgical residents and to answer the long-term effect of the program.","L70470700     2011-07-20 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

I. and Dennie, T. M. and Tabbal, S. D. and Hutton, T. J. and Hicks, G. M. and O'Sullivan, P. S.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000187428600008,English,,,"The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is widely used by medical, nursing, and allied-health professionals in the management and study of patients with Parkinson disease (PD), who sometimes present with decreased speech intelligibility. As such, examining the reliability of speech intelligibility ratings using the UPDRS is critical in evaluating its utility as an instrument for identifying and documenting the nature of the speech deficits. Previous research has suggested that the reliability of speech intelligibility ratings made by neurologists using the UPDRS is questionable, perhaps due to vague written instructions for obtaining a valid nonstandardized speech sample. Also, there is no literature to date reporting the reliability of speech intelligibility ratings made by clinicians live at the time of patient examination versus ratings later made from audiotape recordings. Furthermore, there is no literature to date that reports the reliability of expert speech-language pathologists' ratings of speech intelligibility using the UPDRS nor how those ratings might compare to those of medical experts. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the interrater and intrarater reliability of speech intelligibility ratings made by medical and nonmedical experts using a standardized speech protocol and modified rating criteria for the Speech item of the Motor Examination subscale of the UPDRS. Three medical experts (a neurologist with expertise in movement disorders, a neurology chief resident, and a registered nurse with experience with movement-disordered patients) and three certified speech-language pathologists with expertise in motor speech disorders rated the tape-recorded speech of 19 subjects with mild PD. For the sample of mildly dysarthric speech obtained for this study, interrater reliability for both the medical experts and the speech-language pathologists was greater than .70 (p < .05), and for the two physicians it was greater than .90 (p < .05). Mean intrarater reliability for all listeners was .90, for the medical experts it was .86, and for the speech-language pathologists it was .93 (p < .05). For both the movement disorders specialist and the speech-language pathologist present during examination of the patient, intrarater reliability for in-clinic versus audiotape ratings was greater than .80 (p < .05). These findings suggest that with the use of a standardized speech protocol, the Speech item in the Motor Examination subscale of the UPDRS can be used reliably by medical experts and speech-language pathologists to assess the speech intelligibility of patients with mild PD.","755ty     Times Cited:4     Cited References Count:48 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"

Given the relative rarity of critically ill children outside of the PICU, pediatric residents receive most of their exposure to critical care during their PICU rotations. However, given seasonal variations in disease presentations and the ebbs and flow of patient care, residents' experiences during their PICU rotation vary even within the same institution. This may lead to different learning opportunities, with some residents receiving little to no exposure to certain important topics during their PICU rotation. Methods: The authors reviewed both the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education program requirements for graduate medical education in pediatrics as well as the content outline published by the American Board of Pediatrics for the General Pediatrics certification examination. Considering resident exposures during other rotations, 22 topics were chosen as being most important to be taught by PICU faculty. Of the 22 topics, 11 were designated core topics and the other 11 were designated supplementary topics. Results: Residents were provided a PICU Passport at the beginning of their 4-week PICU rotation, during which each resident was expected to hear about all 11 core topics and 5/11 supplementary topics from a PICU faculty member. Completed Passports were due back to the pediatric chief residents. PICU faculty members were providedLearning Objectives for each topic, and were asked to cover requested topics either during rounds, small-group discussions, or in 1-on-1 discussions. Feedback will be sought from residents via pre and post-rotation surveys, as well as from faculty 6 mo after implementation. Conclusions: The PICU Passport targets specific topics to be covered during the PICU rotation, helping pediatric residents achieve a standard and baseline exposure to certain high-yield topics. The Passport also assists PICU faculty streamline teaching time to individual residents' learning needs.","Suppl. 1     Dk2xt     247     Times Cited:0     Cited References Count:0 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lindsay""=>false}"
